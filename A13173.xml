            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Through diſorder of ſome, &amp; ignorance in others, to ſpeake nothing of pinching &amp; falſe reckonings, hitherto her Maieſtie hath not bene reſolued to bring into the field a ſufficient armie: and thoſe ſmall forces, if I may ſo call ſuch ſmal troupes, that haue bene employed in diuers ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices, haue wanted much of their neceſſary prouiſions: not that the charge is ſo great that it could not be borne, nor for that her care was leſſe then is conuenient.

            <p>Wherefore ſeeing it hath pleaſed God, not only to make your Lordſhip acquainted, but alſo partaker of the common calamities of ſouldiers, and giuen you fauour and acceſſe to her Maieſtie in whom it lyeth to reforme theſe abuſes; as you haue hitherto employed your perſon and goods in the ſeruice of her, and your countrey, ſo I beſeech you ceaſe not, vntill ſuch time, as you haue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed the redreſſe of theſe diſorders. theſe are they that without any one ſtroke of the enemie, haue broken our enterpriſes. it is not the courage of the Spaniard, nor force of the Dutch, nor brauerie of the French, that hath fruſtrated our late attemptes; neither doeth force ſo often ouerthrow armies in fielde, as daliance, irreſolution, and delay; then through niggardiſe, and good husbandry, want of pay, and neceſſarie furniture; thirdly, preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and want of ſtrength and ſufficient force; and laſtly, thoſe abuſes which through want haue crept into armies of late time, &amp; for pitie could not be corrected. for what conſcience is it to puniſh thoſe that ſpoyle and wander abroad, when if they ſhould not thus doe, they ſhould ſterue for hunger? if a Generall haue ſufficient force and prouiſion, it is his fault, if he doe nothing: if he want ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther force, or pay, then it is their fault that ſhould haue ſent him foorth better prouided. many doe great wrong to our Generals in the Portugall expedition, when they impute the fault to them. God knoweth that with ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:18564:8"/>ſlender prouiſion, nothing could be done more. others that are more deepely to be charged for breaking that enterpriſe, yea and famiſhing of many poore ſoules lye hid, and I thinke meane not to anſwere, vntill ſuch time as God ſhall call them before his tribunall ſeate, there to anſwere once for all.</p>
            <p>If any meanes could bee deuiſed, that abuſes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſts, and falſe muſters and accounts taken away, loyall captaines might be choſen, and poore ſouldiers be well furniſhed, and that matters might proceed with ſpeede, and reſolution, and more force bee ioyned together: I would then hope, there would be ſome ſeruice done. without forces co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, what reaſon hath any to hope for better? for as a little water ſprinkled on the fire doth make the ſame more to flame, and ſparkle; ſo ſmall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies doe rather kindle, and nouriſh warres, then ende them, or exſtinguiſh them. The onely meanes to redreſſe both theſe, and all other diſorders conſiſteth in the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and by ſharpe puniſhment mainteining of true mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie diſcipline, and orders. Without this, as a diſcra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zied body is eaſily diſſolued without outward force; ſo an armie though neuer ſo great, without one blow of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie is broken, and ſcattered without doing any effect. With exerciſe of armes and obſeruance of true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of war great enterpriſes moſt happily are atchieued.</p>

If then we either deſire, or will hope for good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe in martiall affaires, nay if wee meane to mainteine our ſtate, and our reputation; of force we muſt obſerue mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarie and martiall orders: Which if once by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips meanes, I might ſee reſtored, which I doe hope; then would I not feare either the malice, or power, or riches of the Spaniard, or other forreine enemie of this ſtate. This therefore is the thing which eſpecially I commend to your care: which indeede is the cauſe of the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and ought to be the care of all that loue the honour, peace, and proſperitie of the ſame.</p>
            <p>For confirmation of your Lordſhips iudgement, that well knoweth more then I can ſay, and for direction to ſuch as be ignorant: I haue, as neere as I could, deſcribed the right courſe &amp; true diſcipline of armes confirmed by ancient &amp; later precedents of moſt expert warriors: and becauſe it ſo pleaſed your Lordſhip, publiſhed the ſame: I haue likewiſe ſet downe not only the proceedings, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the cauſes and neceſſary prouiſions of warres, without which all order is vaine, and all proceeding without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. The ſame I haue conſecrated to my countries ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour vnder the fauour of your honourable name. Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe therefore (my good Lord) to accept this my ſimple goodwil, not worthy the name of a gift. Yet is it all which I haue wonne not onely by long obſeruation, but alſo by dangerous experience both in France, Italy, Flanders, and Portugall. It grieued me not a litle being in her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſeruice, to ſee ſuch confuſion among vs, but much more that our wants were ſuch, that wee could not exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute lawes. The cauſes I haue declared before. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
<pb facs="tcp:18564:9"/>I haue ſet downe in the diſcourſe following after. The which, for that your L. ſeemed to like the ſame, and for that I doe thinke it may be profitable to my countrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and fellowes in armes that ſtil continue that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; I thought it good vnder the ſhadow of your hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable fauour to communicate to others.</p>
            <p>Partly delayes and preſumption, and partly diſorder and miſgouernment, and partly want of neceſſary proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions doth more hurt oftentimes, then the enemies open force. Of all diſorders the onely remedie and medicine is, as I haue ſaide, true diſcipline of armes, which I haue here to my vttermoſt skill and endeuour declared, and with diuers examples of moſt renowmed Captaines confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. againſt whoſe doings many may percaſe repugne, but none can take iuſt exceptions.</p>
            <p>I would once I might ſee the ſame put in execution vnder your Lordſhips gouernance: (for what auayleth knowledge of law without execution &amp; practiſe?) if not, yet ſhall I wiſh all honour and good to thoſe that ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuour to put orders in execution. If any good come of my labours, the ſame is wholly to be aſcribed to your Lordſhip, whoſe ſingular fauour towards me both at home and abroade, gaue me firſt occaſion, leiſure, and meanes to write theſe diſcourſes; if none, yet I truſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different men will accept my good meaning. My purpoſe was, if my experience, hauing nowe almoſt ceaſſed from all ſuch weariſome trauailes, could doe others good, to affoord them all the helpe I could, and alſo to giue my countrey aduertiſements, concerning ſuch matters as are very important, &amp; requiſite to be generally knowen: that order may be taken in time.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Any doe wonder, ſome complaine, and thoſe that haue leaſt intereſt, if ſo bee they haue any loue to their Countrey, they cannot chuſe but lament, that in thoſe warlike actions which of late yeeres haue bene attempted publikely, the ſucceſſe hath beene ſo ſlender, the loſſe of men ſo great, the charge ſo bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome, and the proceedings and effects ſo contrary to antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and as naturall affection leadeth them, I doubt not, but ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are inquiſitiue and deſirous to know the cauſes. And to ſay trueth, good it were that the true cauſes of diſorders were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely knowne, that not onely thoſe that are wrongfully charged may be cleared, but that thoſe that laugh in others griefes, and riſe out of the common ruines might be knowen, and rewarded: at leaſt that the cauſes of former diſorders may bee remoued, and that ſuch prouiſion and order as hath beene hitherto wanting, may in time to come, and in time alſo be better ſupplied. For this cauſe I haue framed this diſcourſe. Wherein when thou ſhalt ſee what is required in the orderly proceeding and managing of warres; thou maieſt eaſily ſee what we wanted, and (I feare me) ſhal want, vnleſſe it pleaſe God to touch mens hearts with a more zelous care of their countries honour hereafter. I doe not meane any one ſpeciall man more then others, God is my witneſſe. What ſoeuer he is that by delayes, irreſolution, niggardiſe, rapine, cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardiſe, trechery, and other villeny abuſeth his prince, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: let him not thinke that I aime particularly at his perſon; but at delayes, irreſolution, niggardiſe, rapine, briberie, cowardiſe, trechery, want of skill, and ſuch other abuſes. I haue no meaning to touch any thing that may ſound to any mans hurt or diſgrace. And therefore although I haue ſtore of domeſticall examples,
<pb facs="tcp:18564:11"/>yet haue I choſen rather to exemplifie abuſes by forreine hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. My purpoſe is to doe good to all without hurt to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, vnleſſe percaſe thoſe that liue vpon pillage, doe account the common good to be their priuate hurt, when the meanes of their gaine ſhall be taken from them. If then thou deſireſt to ſee the cauſes of former loſses, or els wiſheſt to know how breaches of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time may be repayred; behold but this treatiſe, wherein as thou ſhalt ſee the good ſucceſse of all thoſe that proceeded orderly, and like men of warre: ſo thou mayeſt alſo ſee, that thoſe that haue neglected diſcipline of armes, and warlike proceeding, haue had euents and ſucceſſe according to their deſeruing.</p>
            <p>Now to the intent thou maieſt the better both addreſſe thy affaires, if thou haſt any charge in warres, and vnderſtand the proceeding and continuance of warres, and warlike actions; I haue followed in this diſcourſe the order of time, ſetting downe thoſe things firſt, which are firſt to bee conſidered, prouided, and executed; and ſo proſecuting euery action of warre ſeuerally by it ſelfe. Thoſe that haue done otherwiſe, I ſee they haue trifled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way many words without any ſmall profite. They talke of rankes and arayes at large, others of building of fortreſses: (that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to a good Serieant properly, this to a good maſon.) But howe ſouldiers ſhalbe prouided, and how they ſhall proceede, and howe ſouldiers and fortreſſes are to be gouerned, they ſcarce mention; ſure few of them know, or can declare. Beſides theſe they omit manie other neceſſarie poyntes of warre, wherein the ſafetie of an armie, and a state conſiſteth. Wherefore omitting, or ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly handling thoſe ſleight poyntes; I haue choſen other matters more important to dilate, beginning first with the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of warres: then with the prouiſion, that is made before warres be attemted. For although ſouldiers are the principall actors in theſe tragicall matters: yet before wee drawe an army into the fielde, or make leuie of ſouldiers, manie things are to be conſidered, and prouided. Firſt wee are to conſider, that our
<pb facs="tcp:18564:11"/>cauſe be good, and iuſt. For warres without cauſe are nothing, but robbery and violence contrary to humanitie, and reaſon: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly all things neceſsary for the warres are to be prouided: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are ſouldiers to be leuied, and exerciſed, and ſo brought into the field to proſecute all other neceſsary faits of armes.</p>
            <p n="1">1 Firſt therefore I will (God willing) declare, what cauſes make warres iuſt, or vniuſt, and what are the effects of lawfull warres, and therein alſo what ſolemnities, or circumſtances are to be conſidered in defiance of our enemies, or firſt attempts of warre.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Secondly, what prouiſion is to be made of treaſure, armes, munition, victuals, ſhips by ſea, and carriages and tents by land.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that wee are to ſtrengthen our ſelues with the helpe of confederates, and aſsociates, ſo much as we can, and to draw what friends, or ſtrength wee can from the enemie, both before we attempt warres, and after.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, what partes, and qualities are required in a General, and what counſell he is to adioyne to himſelfe, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is better to giue ſouereigne authoritie in warres to one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or to more: likewiſe what authority and commiſsion the Generall ought to haue: further what is to bee reſpected in the choyce of Colonels, of Captaines of companies, and other officers of the army: and what in the choyce of common ſouldiers: what othe they are to take, and how much the ſouldiers of our owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be preferred before ſtrangers: what inconueniences enſue of want of pay: what numbers of ſouldiers are required in warres, and finally, how ſouldiers are to be exerciſed, that they may be made ready for the warres.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fiftly, what things are to be conſidered of thoſe that are to tranſport an army by ſea, or by land into an other countrey: and whether it is better for the Engliſh nation to inuade the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, or any other forreine enemie in his owne countrey, then to receiue his aſſault at home, or to ſtay vntil he come on our coaſt,
<pb facs="tcp:18564:12"/>or within our countrey: and laſtly what cautions ſouldiers ſent abroade in ſuccour and ayde of other nations are to vſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Sixtly, what order and aray an army is to obſerue in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and how the ſame may march ſafely in the enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, ſurmounting all difficulties, whereby either in champion, or wooddy countries, or els in the paſsage of riuers, or hilles, and ſtraites it may be diſordred, ſtopped, or hindred.</p>
            <p n="7">7 And for that we are not onely to offend, but alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to defend, we are alſo to ſhewe what oppoſitions, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſes the defendants are to make, thereby to ſtoppe the progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and marche of the enemie: and how to ſend our men ſafely forth on forraging, and howe to ſtoppe, and cut off the enemies forragers.</p>
            <p n="8">8 For that oft times, time is vainely ſpent in deliberations, daliances and delayes, to the impoueriſhing of many ſtates, and ouerthrow of many good actions; we will ſhew by many proofes, that nothing is more aduantageous then expedition, and celerity in preparing, marching, executing, fighting, and all enterpriſes of warre; nor any thing more hurtfull or dangerous, then delaies.</p>
            <p n="9">9 What orders are to be obſerued, in the fortifying, defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and gouerning of our campe and lodging, that we be not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged a l'improuiſta, or eaſily forced to fight.</p>
            <p n="10">10 We will alſo ſhewe, that as the aſſaylants in the enemies countrey are to ſeeke that the matter may be ſoone tried by bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell: ſo the defendants without great aduantage are to auoyde it: and further by what meanes the enemie may be brought to fight, and how thoſe that feare to fight, may auoyde the encounter with leaſt loſse.</p>
            <p n="11">11 Before the Generall doeth bring foorth his armie into the fielde, many things are to be conſidered, all which ſhalbe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the eleuenth Chapter.</p>
            <p n="12">12 In the twelfth we are to diſcourſe of the aray, and charge of an armie encountring the enemie in open fielde: and therein
<pb facs="tcp:18564:12"/>of the vſe of horſemen, of pikes, halberds, targets, ſmall ſhot, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie, and great ordonance.</p>
            <p n="13">13 In the thirteenth ſhall follow a briefe treatiſe of ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gemes, ambuſhes, and whatſoeuer deuiſes ſerue for the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy atchieuing of our purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="14">14 After the victorie once obteined, and the enemie van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, in the next Chapter we are to ſhew, how the victorie is to be vſed, and the conqueſt may beſt be mainteined.</p>
            <p n="15">15 And becauſe the hazard of warre is doubtfull, in the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth Chapter we purpoſe to declare, by what meanes an army that is foyled, or feareth to fight, may moſt ſafely, or with least danger, or loſſe retire, and howe the enemie in following the courſe of his victorie may be ſtopped.</p>
            <p n="16">16 The ſixteenth Chapter ſhall conteine precepts, and orders for the gouernment of a camp that beſiegeth a citie or fort, and what courſe is beſt in beſieging, battering, aſſaulting, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the ſame.</p>
            <p n="17">17 For the behoofe of the defendants, the 17. ſhall declare what proceeding is beſt in the defence and gouernment of a towne or place aſsayled, beſieged, battered, aſsaulted, or demy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced.</p>
            <p n="18">18 And for that ſea townes are not eaſily defended, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged without a nauie at ſea; in the next place followeth a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the vſe of ſhips of warre, and how they are to be prouided, ranged, and managed in ſea-fightes.</p>
            <p n="19">19 Next vnto the execution of warres followeth the treaty of peace, truce, and confederacies, of which we are in the 19. Chapter to intreate, and alſo of the aſſurance of articles of peace, truce, and confederacie, and likewiſe of the priuiledges of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, and meſſengers by which ſuch matters are treated and brought to paſſe.</p>
            <p n="20">20 After warres enſue rewardes of ſuch, as haue behaued themſelues valiantly in the ſeruice of their countrey: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:18564:13"/>in the 20. Chapter we are to entreat of the rewards of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant ſouldiers, &amp; puniſhment of cowards and diſorderly perſons.</p>
            <p n="21">21 In the laſt Chapter, for that our ſouldiers are for the moſt part raw and ignorant, and would haue things expreſſed and taught them plainely, I haue gathered together certaine milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie orders, ſome concerning religion &amp; manners; others concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; eſpecially tending to the common ſafetie of the ſtate, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, or garriſon, or els concerning the ſpeciall dueties of captains or common ſouldiers; others reſpecting the campe, or towne of garriſon; others ſpecially belonging to ſea cauſes, and aduentures at ſea; others to the Officers of the army, or fleete; others concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning booties, ſpoyles, and priſoners; and ſome concerning the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of lawes and adminiſtration of iustice. out of which I would haue ſo many as are fitting for the ſeruice in hand to be choſen out, and put in writing, and proclaymed openly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered vnto euery captaine or colonell, that euery man may vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſome part of his duetie, and what puniſhment is due for his offences.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I haue for thy ſake not without great labour brought together, and layde foorth in this forme which I haue declared.

I neede not vſe anie long diſcourſe in this matter: it hath beene the continuall vſe of the Kings of this Ilande to vſe the helpe of the Burguygnions, and low Countries againſt France. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe haue the French relyed much vpon the ayde of the Scots a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs.</p>
               <p>Neither ought anie Prince, or nation ſo to preſume of their owne ſtrength, as that they refuſe the ayde of friends. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes although after their victories againſt <hi>Annibal,</hi> at what time they beganne the Macedonian warre, they were in their prime of ſtrength, and moſt flouriſhing eſtate; yet required they ayde of the Carthaginians, of <hi>Maſiniſſa,</hi> and of the <hi>Aetolians,</hi> and others againſt <hi>Philip</hi> King of Macedonia. And deare it coſt <hi>Perſeus</hi> the King of Macedonia, <hi>that for ſparing of money refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ayde of thirtie thouſand Gaules offering to ſerue him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Romanes.</hi> What hinderance it hath beene to vs, and what it may bee that the Towne of Antwerpe, and other partes of the lowe Countreyes were not receiued when they were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18564:28"/>vnto vs in theſe brawles againſt <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> I knowe not, ſome doubt. It may be ſayd, they would not yeelde without conditions. But what purpoſe is it, to talke of conditions, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would haue yeelded themſelues into any princes handes, if they might haue bene receiued?</p>
               <p>Further as we are to require ayde of our friends; ſo we are to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe what ayde we can from the enemie. Many reaſons teach vs ſo to doe, which common practiſe doeth teach vs to be true. as the body in the diſtemper of the partes: ſo the ſtate in the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the members, is greatly weakened, and eaſily diſſolued. The <hi>Romanes</hi> therefore as they were maſters in other militarie documents, ſo did they diligently practice intelligence with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies friendes, and ſubiectes. Before they tranſported their forces into <hi>Afrike,</hi> they dealt with <hi>Syphax,</hi> and aſſured themſelues of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiniſſa</hi> kings of <hi>Numidia.</hi> Before they charged <hi>Philippe</hi> king of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> they cauſed moſt of his partiſans in <hi>Greece</hi> to reuolt from him. And <hi>Caeſar</hi> by the helpe of part of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> which he drewe to his ſide, did ſubdue the reſt, and them alſo afterward.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pompey</hi> purpoſing to abaſe the power of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> did firſt drawe from him two legions or regiments, and afterward <hi>Labienus</hi> one of <hi>Caeſars</hi> chiefe friendes, and commaunders. Of this onely practice great effectes are wont to enſue. <hi>Caeſar</hi> by diſioyning and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the forces and cauſes of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> ouercame them all. By his intelligence with the ancient <hi>Britons,</hi> hee vnderſtoode the eſtate of the countrey, and had great helpe to atchieue his purpoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it.</p>
               <p>While they of the citie of<note n="a" place="margin">Phil. Comin.</note>

We haue alſo domeſticall examples of the ſame but too many, and which I cannot without ſome griefe remember. not with dint of ſword, nor open force, but with ſecret practices with our aſſociates and friendes in <hi>France,</hi> the French tooke not onely <hi>Normandy,</hi> but alſo <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> and <hi>Guienne</hi> from

                  <hi>ayde of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they are for the moſt part a ſpoyle vnto the enemie.</hi> And if we would haue vſed greater force, and more diligence in with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing from the <hi>Spaniard</hi> his aſſociates, and ſubiects of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> of the Ilands, and of the Low countreys; hee would haue bene long ere this very gentle to deale withall. But ſome wiſe men, as they ſay, haue not onely not ſought to cauſe his ſubiects to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolt, but haue refuſed, and ſtill refuſe to receiue them, that holde out their hands, crauing helpe of friends and long ſince are weary of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> tyranny.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe, that ſuppoſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to haue ſuch holde of all the countreys which nowe they poſſeſſe, and of the inhabitants thereof, that we ſhould but looſe labour in attempting their reuolt, they ſeeme to be ignorant not onely of the ſtate of his countreys, and of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gouernement, but alſo of the nature of things. It is well knowen with what diſcontentment, and grudge both the <hi>Portugals,</hi> and thoſe of the Lowe countreys doe ſerue the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard.</hi> The <hi>Portugals</hi> were ready to receiue vs at our laſt expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thither, and would haue declared themſelues further, if they had perceiued, that wee had bene able to defend them againſt the <hi>Spaniard.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſtate of <hi>Milan</hi> is holden more by force, then by loue, or good title. They of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicile</hi> haue by many ſignes decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their great diſcontentment of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> yoke. The <hi>Indians</hi> would reuolt, if they knewe which way. In all countreys there are euer ſome, that either for <hi>hope;</hi> or hatred deſire change of ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Annibal</hi> after that hee had once, or twiſe beaten the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> in <hi>Italy:</hi> did afterwarde mainteine the warres for the moſt

Vpon the firſt ouerthrow which <hi>Scipio</hi> gaue to the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in Affrike, he cauſed moſt of the countrey to turne enemie againſt them.</p>
               <p>Neither may we thinke that the ſtate of Spaine is in this point, better then other nations, eſpecially ſeeing the ſtirres in Aragon, and Grenade beſide many other offers in Caſtile, doe declare, that there are among them many mal-contents. The Spaniard doubteth not to finde many ſuch among vs, but it were to be wiſhed, that we would rather make triall firſt, whether there were any ſuch to be found in Spaine. When the French made their expeditions into<note n="a" place="margin">Guicciard.

               <p>But while we ſeeke to augment our forces with the ſuccours of our aſſociates and friendes; we are not ſo to rely vpon them, but that we prepare ſufficient forces of our owne nation, both to reſiſt the enemie, and if neede be to commaund our aſſociates. therein fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the wiſe proceedings of the Romanes, that neuer would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a greater number of aſſociates, then they had of their citizens in their army; and had alwayes an eye, that they practiſed not with the enemie. <hi>In this as in</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to that opinion which Princes and States haue of their Captaines, and ſometimes reſpect had to the danger of the times: their vſe is to giue vnto them more ample, or more ſtraite commiſſion. But if they purpoſe, that their affaires ſhal ſucceed wel, of two things one is neceſſarie: to wit, that either they furniſh them with meanes ſufficient, or giue them commiſſion to furniſh and helpe themſelues: and that either they doe direct them ſufficiently, which is ſcarce poſſible: or els giue them leaue to take order according to the occaſions offered vpon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent viewe, and varietie of times, or things. For neither can he doe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18564:40"/>ſeruice vpon the enemie, that wanteth either conuenient force or meanes; nor may he, or dare he take the aduantage of time, and other circumſtances, that is brideled and bound by his inſtructions. The <hi>Romanes</hi> although moſt expert in deedes of armes, whoſe Senate conſiſted for the moſt part of ſuch as in their time had bene comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and altogether of men exerciſed in armes; yet did not at any time preſcribe their Generals what to doe; and what they ſhould not doe; much leſſe howe they ſhould doe, or when they ſhould doe it. Much more abſurd therefore it is, that men that neuer ſawe enemie, nor know the traine of warres, ſhould take vpon them to direct Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals what they ſhould doe at land, or ſea: and very ſtrange it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, that Generals to whome armies are committed ſhould like ſchooleboyes take forth ſuch leſſons, as theſe ignorant pedants and ſcriuanoes ſhould preſcribe. Warres are not made by indenture, neither can any couenant with his enemie to doe this, or not to doe it. Nor can any man conceiue, what is beſt to be done, but ſuch as are preſent. And therefore the ordinary limitations of ſome commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, doe nothing els, but binde the hands of our captaines, that they ſhall not vſe opportunitie, or percaſe further and helpe the enemie. Herein therefore it is good to imitate olde warriers, at leaſt to come ſo neere them, as difference of times will permit. The <hi>Romane</hi> cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines had authoritie moſt large, and meanes ſufficient. Their forces were great, their furniture and prouiſion plentifull. leaſt they ſhould exact any thing of their aſſociats, they <hi>were furniſhed with all things</hi>

                     <hi>execution of warres,</hi> which ought not to be hindred, nor can conueniently be preſcribed. And without large aucthoritie, neither can our owne ſouldiers, nor aſſociats be well gouerned. The experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the ſeruice in the Lowe Countries, and diſorders at ſea, which for want of power haue not bene redreſſed, doe miniſter vnto vs ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofe of this matter. Some will ſay, that it is dangerous to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18564:42"/>commit ſo large power into any mans hands, eſpecially if he ſhould deale diſloyally. But what a reaſon is this, becauſe men may abuſe their power, not to giue them ſufficient power for thoſe matters which are committed to their charge? Thoſe that meane diſloyally to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the State, although they ſhould haue neuer ſo ſtrait limitations in their commiſſions, would not ſtand vpon termes, and wordes of lawe. And rather it giueth them occaſion of diſcontentment, when they ſee themſelues diſtruſted, then bridleth any euill purpoſe, if they ſhould doe againſt their allegiance. And why ſhould any man without cauſe ſuſpect any noble man, that he will deale againſt his Countrey, hauing ſo many pledges of his loyaltie? but if any ſhould be ſo euill diſpoſed, yet may we not thinke, that all his army would follow him, rebelling againſt his Countrey. And if they ſhould, yet is it not the force of one armie, that can preuaile againſt a whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that is well gouerned. And therefore for feare of diſloyaltie of ſome; let no man feare, or omitte to make ſufficient prouiſion; and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let loyall men be ſought out with diligence, and diſloyall men remoued, then that the neceſſarie prouiſions of warre ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, or the proceeding hindred for want of aucthoritie.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18564:42"/>
                     <hi>L. Martius</hi> was choſen General by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reliques of <hi>Scipios</hi> armie in <hi>Spaine,</hi> but that was in caſe of neceſſitie, &amp; endured no longer, then vnto ſuch time, as they had other captaines ſent them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Rome.</hi> To take vpon him a charge without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, is within caſe of treaſon, &amp; ſauoureth of rebellion. The Prince is not to hazard his perſon, nor his honor vpon euery light occaſion. King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning out of <hi>Poland,</hi> receiued a ſcorne at the ſiege of <hi>Liuron,</hi> a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Hamlet in <hi>Dauphinè,</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being preſent in perſon, &amp; that being his firſt attempt after his returne into his kingdome, he could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieue it. The <hi>French</hi> ſince their King was taken by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> do not eaſily ſuffer their kings to come in perſon into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field. <hi>But if the</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The third point, by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which hath bin ſpoken already may be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. For in a General, wiſdome &amp; courage would be ſo tempered, that neither he hazard his perſon further then reaſon, nor doubt to execute good counſel for feare. The taking of <hi>Francis</hi> the <hi>French</hi> king by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> &amp; king <hi>Iohn</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> put the Realme of <hi>France</hi> in great hazard.

                     <hi>Vitellius.</hi> The whole office of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> General conſiſteth in the ſpeeding, &amp; direction of all matters of warre; of which we haue occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to intreate in this whole diſcourſe. And therefore for theſe points this may be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Nowe for that the Generall cannot doe all himſelfe, but muſt vſe colonels, captaines, and officers, for the execution of his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; we are to ſhew what paines, &amp; care he is to haue, that they be well choſen, &amp; doe their duety ſufficiently. Colonels would be choſen of ſuch noblemen, knights, &amp; gentlemen, as for their yeeres, ſeruice, experience, diſcretion, manhood, and other vertues doe beſt deſerue thoſe places.

                  <p>Centurions, or captaines of companies, would be choſen of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt ſtrong, valiant, diſcreete, and actiue ſouldiers: ſuch eſpecially as both know the traine of warres, &amp; are of body able to endure labour. Their office is to leade, and gouerne their men, to looke that their bodies, armes, and clothes be in order: that they haue victuals, and things neceſſary, &amp; execute ſuch ſpecial commandements as are giuen them. There is no certaine rule of their office to be preſcribed. For as there are more or fewer companies together; ſo they doe more or leſſe. Where there are but <hi>2.</hi> or <hi>3.</hi> companies together, the captains do all, as chiefe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manders in an army: where an army ſtandeth together, they ſhould be the firſt men of their companies: out of aray they are to attend y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> generall officers commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.

                  <p>The officers of companies, namely lieutenants, enſignes, ſergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, corporals, are choſen by the captaines of companies. But much
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:18564:44"/>better it were, if as ſome doe, ſo all did chuſe them of their moſt able and valiant ſouldiers, without reſpect, or fauour.</p>
                  <p>Other officers, are choſen ſome for the gouernment, others for the prouiſion of the army. Of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſort are the campmaſters or marſhals with their ſerieant maior, &amp; field coporals, colonel general, lieutenant general of the horſe, ſcoutemaſters, trenchmaſters, quartermaſters, and ſuch like. Which all tend one way, &amp; are but partes of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals duety, which in time paſt he executed by his legates, or lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants &amp; tribunes. The maſter of the Ordonance, &amp; captaine of Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are likewiſe but of a late inuention, ſince y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of artillerie came in, and ſouldiers through ſlouth began to refuſe the labours of warre. The iudge and prouoſt marſhall ſucceede alſo in a part of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals care for deciding and executing matters of iuſtice. The muſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter likewiſe is of a late ſtampe, namely ſince captaines began to pay the ſouldiers, and Princes began to be defrauded of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and their treaſure. Of the ſecond ſort are all Commiſſaries for the pay of ſouldiers, for victuals, armes, munition, carriages, and whatſoeuer other prouiſion neceſſary. For good choice whereof there is but one generall rule to be obſerued, to wit, that all partiality and affection laid aſide, ſuch be placed in gouernment as be ſkilfull, loyal, valiant, diligent, and haue reſpect of honour, not of profite, and in offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of prouiſion, ſuch as haue knowledge in ſuch matters, &amp; will deale faithfully. Such as ambitiouſly, or greedily ſue for ſuch places, are not lightly to be heard: and although they be once placed; yet if they be conuicted of inſufficiencie, or negligence, or fraude, they are exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarly to be puniſhed, or at the leaſt remoued.</p>

A matter in our times either not at al, or very litle regarded. For when occaſion is offered of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice: then for the moſt part order is giuen either to the officers of euery Pariſh, to take vp roges, or maſterles men, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of priſons, ſuch as if they had their deſerts, they were to be ſent rather to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gallowes, then to the warres for the moſt part: or if a greater number muſt be taken; to the officers in the Countrey, men

But if Princes meane to haue their honour and countrey defended, or their eſtate mainteined, or ſeruice done vpon the enemie, they muſt haue more regard to chuſe men of more ſtrength, honeſtie, and abilitie; ſuch as haue reaſon to fight for their Countrey, and haue care of their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt reputation, and are aſhamed of villeny, and lewde doing. For how can captaines encourage thoſe to fight for their countrey, lands, goods, and honor, that haue neither houſe nor home, nor reſpect of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty or ſhame, nor care though all were fired, ſo they might hooke ſomewhat? and yet forſooth the Generals &amp; commanders, that of late time haue bin emploied haue bin blamed, that they haue not obſerued the rules of militarie diſcipline among theſe men. As if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keepe famiſhed men from ſnatching of victuals, or drunkardes from drinke, or to maſter men that are maſterles, or to keepe rogues in order, or to make loyterours to worke, or pilferors to march in aray and keepe order, or to preſerue them aliue that haue neither paye, nor prouiſion in time, nor one peny to helpe themſelues in their neede. If they will therefore haue order kept, let them chooſe out men capable of gouernment, &amp; ſouldiers, not raſcals.

In the meane time wee may learne what hath bene the practice of times paſt in the choyſe of ſouldiers, and what rules ought nowe to be practiſed.</p>
                  <p>In the choice of ſouldiers, we are eſpecially to reſpect three things: firſt, the ſtrength of the body: ſecondly, the vigour and vertues of the mind: and thirdly, the maner and trade of the parties liuing. <hi>Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and certaine idle <hi>Italians,</hi> giue precepts concerning the climate, countrey, and diuers ſituations of regions, which they would haue in the choiſe of ſouldiers to be reſpected: but experience teacheth vs, that oft times valiant men are found in Cities, and fruitfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, yea vnder hotte climates which they condemne, and cowardes in hilles and rockes, and Northren Regions, which they commend. True it is, that Northren people are commonly more valiant and venturous, then thoſe of <hi>Aſia</hi> &amp; <hi>Afrike,</hi> that are from vs farre Eaſt,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18564:45"/>and ſouth. But what doth that conſideration help vs, that make our leuies of ſouldiers not in <hi>Aſia</hi> nor <hi>Affrike;</hi> but here in England, and Ireland, and thereabout? whether therefore ſouldiers be brought vp in the citie or country, or bred in hilles or valleis, or champaine coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in the north or ſouth of England, I reſpect not: but if they haue ſtrength of body to endure labours, and a mind vigorous and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and an honeſt diſpoſition, and haue liued ſuch a life, as hath beene tried ſomtimes in labour, I refuſe them not whereſoeuer they haue beene bred. Nay I wiſh to haue ſuch. Contrariwiſe cowards and weake perſons, and men of lewd conditions, or which haue bene tenderly brought vp, I would refuſe although they come from the north or hilly countries.</p>

But if I might be heard, I woulde neither wiſh ſuch men to be ſought for: (for ſeldome are great and bigge men able to endure trauel) nor men of a meane or ſhort ſtature to be refuſed, if they haue ſtrong and actiue bodies. Men of meane ſtature are for the moſt part more vigorous and couragious; they do more eaſily endure labors, and commonly excell great bodied men in ſwiftneſſe and running, which is a matter in a ſouldier verie requiſite and commendable.<note n="a" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getius</hi> ſaith, <hi>it is bettet to haue ſtout and ſtrong, then huge and big ſouldiers.</hi> Such <hi>Caeſar</hi> commonly did chuſe. and experience ſheweth vs, that <hi>men burdened with fleſh can neither endure labour, nor hurts,</hi> whereas the meane ſtature and habite of bodie endureth both.</p>
                  <p>For trial of the ſtrength of a mans body, we are not only to looke vpon the lineaments, and outward proportion of the parts, but rather what the party can do in running, leaping, wraſtling, &amp; ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. For oftentimes an euill-fauoured body may haue a quicke ſtrength, and tall &amp; big perſons may prooue weake, dainty, &amp; ſickly. By the outward apparance, we may notwithſtanding make a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble coniecture of a mans ſtrength. For they that haue a likely body, and a ſharp countenance, and hard fleſh &amp; ſinowy armes and legs, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ful or fleſhy, are likely to proue ſtrong men. Yet do not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of warre admit old men paſt <hi>46.</hi> vnles they be old ſouldiers, for that their ſtrength is decaying, and their bodies leſſe apt to labor: nor
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18564:46"/>youths vnder <hi>20.</hi> vnleſſe it be ſome that by triall declareth himſelfe to haue ſtrength, for that as yet they are not come to their full pitch and ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>But that which ſpecially commendeth ſouldiers, is the vigor of the mind, and good conditions, coniectured by the viſage &amp; outward behauior, but knowen only by their conuerſation; which is to be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of others. If the man be a knowen coward, or of a dull diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or mutinous, or giuen to drinke, or theeuery, or other diſorders, howſoeuer his body ſeeme anſwerable, yet for his lewd maners hee proueth for the moſt part vnprofitable: and is therfore to be repelled, or blotted out of the rolle. In a ſouldier therefore I require firſt,<note n="a" place="margin">Vt audaces ſint &amp; animum habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant &amp; conſiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam militarem.

                  <p>I would likewiſe wiſh that ſouldiers were religious, and thinke it very requiſite, if it might be obtained. The very Pagans did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before they had conſulted with oracles, or ſought to knowe the pleaſure of God by<note n="e" place="margin">Nil niſi auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catò gerebant.

How much more then ought Chriſtians to be religious? There is nothing that more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth the ſouldiers mind, then when he is perſwaded that God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoreth him, &amp; the goodnes of his cauſe. nor worketh more aſſured re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution to die, then when men vnderſtand they go to a better life.

                  <p>The third point which we are to reſpect in the choice of ſouldiers, is the trade of their liuing, although not in equall degree with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two.

                  <p>That the charge of warres is now greater, then in time paſt; is but an improbable ſurmiſe. For wherein ariſeth the charge of an army nowe, but in victuals, armes, clothes, horſes, cariages and ſuch like, which were no leſſe chargeable in time paſt, then now? powder wee haue nowe, and artillerie, which in time paſt was not found out, but the charge of their engins, and the things about them, which nowe we neede not, nor vſe, was no leſſe chargeable to them. So that if we had that order and proceeding, which they had: there is no doubt but wee are as well able to mainteine an armie, as they.</p>
                  <p>Why a ſufficient armie ſhould not bee mainteined and paid, I ſee no reaſon but want of military diſcipline. For ſeeing this land main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teineth ſo many millions at home, there is no reaſon, but the ſame
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18564:51"/>ſhould mainteine <hi>30.</hi> or <hi>40.</hi> thouſand of the ſame number abroad, if right diſcipline of armes were practiſed. The charge of an army is moſt in meate, and apperell. But in theſe things men ſpend no leſſe at home, then abroad. I doe thinke that albeit this land wanted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet if the army were well ſupplyed with victuals and clothes by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Princes Officers, that a great armie might ſufficiently be payd. For that money that ſhould be deliuered to the ſouldier, would moſt of it come backe for victuals and clothes, of which this land (God be thanked) hath no want. The expenſes of munitions, and armes, and other matters are in reſpect of this charge, nothing. But what ſhould I talke of this courſe, when there wanteth neither money, nor other thing, but good orders well executed? The reuenues of the Crowne, the contributions of the ſubiects, and ayde of our friendes, are not ſo ſimple, but that there may be found maintenance ſufficient, if mens good willes and loyal dealing were not wanting. Beſides theſe if our armie were ſufficient to fight with the enemie, I would thinke, there were want of ſkill, or good order, if the ſame did not aſwell liue vpon the enemies ſpoyles, as the Princes pay.</p>

Wherein I vnderſtand that Gouernours of late haue bene carefull, and ſet downe many good orders, but all commeth to this paſſe, that the Captaines ſhall pay their ſouldiers: which doeth
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18564:52"/>promiſe no good effect in this matter. It is a notorious abuſe to giue the pay of the common ſouldier to the Centurion, or Captaine of euery band; neuer vſed by the <hi>Romanes,</hi> nor other nation. It firſt came in among the <hi>Italians</hi> about two hundred and fiftie, or two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeeres agone in their ſcambling warres among themſelues. The reaſon was, for that the Prince that had warres hired the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine out of ſome other State, and the Captaine he hired ſuch ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as he could get. So that the Prince dealing with the Capatine muſt pay him, and the Captaine muſt pay his ſouldiers. Which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon now ceaſing, there is no cauſe why the abuſe ſhould continue. Further there are certaine dead payes allowed to the captaine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colour whereof I doubt not but they will paſſe many dead men, or ſuch as neuer were in moſters. It is aſmuch as if he ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to defraude a Prince a litle, ſo it be but in ſixe dead payes. But better it were and more honorable, if the Prince did allowe the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine an honourable and ſufficient pay, and make others the payma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. It is not poſſible nowe that matters ſhould in theſe caſes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, ſeeing ſuch as haue intereſt in the gaine, are made control<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the offence.</p>
                  <p>Were it not better to pay euery ſouldier by the poll? better I ſay for the Prince. For if the ſouldiers acquitance, moſter booke, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters and controllers accounts agree, he cannot lightly be defrau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either of his money, or of his numbers: better for the common ſouldier: for he ſhall haue his due. Yea better for the Captaines, for they ſhould not be ſo condemned, as they are of the countrey, nor of their ſouldiers, and ſome very wrongfully: and who would for ſo ſmall gaine, incurre the loſſe of his honour, or reputation? but thus they ſhall neither liue themſelues, nor be able to rewarde their ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: As if I wiſhed them not larger pay, and w ih honeſter conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as if they did vſe to reward their men, or that belonged to them. it is the General, that ſhould do it vpon their report, &amp; not they.</p>

The <hi>Romanes</hi> therefore as in other things, ſo in this excelled, that they neuer dealt with any enemie, but with a full army. If the power of the enemie were great, they employed <hi>a Conſulare army</hi> conſiſting of <hi>4.</hi> legions of citizens, beſide the aide of their aſſociates, if leſſe they vſed but two legions, with the ayde of their friendes. The greateſt force that they vſually employed were two Conſular armies ioyned together. The number was diuers, as the legions were greater or leſſer, full or imperfect: but their greateſt force amounted not paſt to <hi>50.</hi> thouſand, their middle to <hi>24.</hi> thouſand, their leaſt to <hi>12,</hi> or <hi>15.</hi> thouſand, or thereaboutes. Leſſe number I doe not reade that they vſed in any ſeruice, and therefore proceeding with ſufficient force, I maruell not, if their ſucceſſe were according.</p>
                  <p>It is the vſe of all nations, neither the <hi>French</hi> in their expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous into <hi>Italy,</hi> nor the <hi>Spaniard</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> vſeth to ſend leſſe then a iuſt army.

Nay further, <hi>a ſufficient force doeth not only worke greater effect, but alſo is leſſe charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:18564:53"/>then warres made by theſe ſlender ſupplies.</hi> It may percaſe ſeem a paradoxe to ſome, but reaſon &amp; experience doth proue it true.</p>
                  <p>Theſe warres of our times, they haue no ende; but where a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient armie goeth, there is an end, eyther one way or other. There is no end of charge in lingring warres: in theſe, if the armie preuaile, the victorie mainteineth the ſame; if it be ouercome, then is there an end of that armie and charge. The burthen is onely in the ſetting of the ſame out, and mainteyning of it in the meane while. But will ſome ſay, the hazard were great. Let them therefore fight valiantly, and not ſuffer themſelues to bee ſkinned. They that forecaſt what windes will blowe, ſeldome ſowe, or ſet ſayle in time.</p>
                  <p>Further, a ſmall force muſt needes lye in Townes, and hide their heads, where the enemie is ſtronger. Againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie they haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength to fight, nor meanes to enterpriſe, &amp; ſtil the Prince is at a continuall charge: and without pay y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſouldiers famiſh: but where a full and ſufficient force arriueth in any Countrey, they commaund the ſame, vnleſſe an armie be preſently oppoſed againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelues with ſpoiles. the fruites they lay vp for their owne ſtore. Many confederates, ſome for feare, others for other cauſes ioyne with them, and either yeeld money, or victuals, or munitions. Whatſoeuer corne, forage, or other prouiſion is without walled Townes, that is theirs. It muſt be a Towne of ſome ſtrength that dare reſiſt them. When the armie is great, the warres mainteyne themſelues, as ſaid <hi>Cato. Scipio</hi> with the profite that he drewe out of the Countrey of <hi>Spaine,</hi> mainteined his armie there diuers yeres. <hi>Sixteene yeres did <hi>Annibal</hi> maintaine warres in Italy, at the charge of that Countrey almoſt without ſupplie of men, or money from Carthage.</hi> With the riches of <hi>France, Caeſar</hi> mainteined his armie <hi>9.</hi> yeeres in <hi>France,</hi> &amp; enriched himſelf, and his countrey. Beſides the charge of the army defraied, many <hi>Romane</hi> captains haue brought in great ſummes of money into the publike treaſurie. Theſe are the fruits of victorie: but victorie cannot be obteined without an armie.</p>
                  <p>If therefore any man hope for the end of warres, or good ſucceſſe in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> or other Countrey; let him wiſh that ſufficient meanes were employed. There is neither honor, ſafetie, profite, nor hope of good hap in the courſe of warres commonly taken. If you will not beleeue me: then examine the proceedings of the ſmal companies that haue bin employed in ſeruice of late time: examine
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:18564:54"/>the ancient and latter hiſtories of forreigne nations, that haue had good ſucceſſe in their warres. If you ſee nothing but diſorder in the one, and reaſon in the other: then let captaines neuer for ſhame on this ſort looſe their men, expend their money, trifle the time, dally with the enemie, contrary to reaſon, and all good proceeding; but let them as in other points, ſo in this alſo returne to the true diſcipline, and practice of warre.</p>

But (may ſome ſay) what neede ſo many wordes in theſe matters: eſpecially if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both the charge, &amp; labour that hath bin ſpent in trayning of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers within our Realme of late time? men able (as ſome thinke) to encounter the moſt florſhing armie in Chriſtendome? againſt whom I haue no purpoſe to ſpeake. Nay I wiſh with al my heart, they were ſo ſtrong, and ready as is imagined. Onely I thought good to ſhewe firſt the defectes in our trayning, which I would wiſh were ſupplied, and our men better inſtructed; and next howe little truſt there is to be put in trayned men, that neuer ſawe enemie, vnleſſe there be many olde ſouldiers mingled among them. In trayning of ſouldiers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in places where I haue bin, theſe wants I haue obſerued. Firſt, the ſouldiers are not alwayes beſt choſen: ſecondly, their bodies are not exerciſed as they ſhould be: thirdly, they are not taught the vſe of their ſeuerall weapons. Fewe teach ſouldiers the right vſe of the piece, and none the vſe of the pike, halberd, and ſworde, and target. Fourthly, the men are rather wearied in marching vp and downe, and wheeling in ringes, and filing of rankes, which are to no vſe in fighting, then inſtructed howe to take their places in marching, in fighting, aſſalting, retiring, or other deede of armes. Fifthly, there is ſeldome or neuer ſufficient companie brought together, ſo that men may conceiue the reaſons of the places of euery ſort of weapons: horſemen are ſeldome ſeene in traynings of ſouldiers. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hardly
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18564:56"/>can any conceiue howe things ſhould ſtand, by any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is ſhewed. Laſtly ſuch for the moſt part vpon ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of ſome great mans letters, are employed in teaching our ſouldiers, as either neuer went to the ſchoole of armes, or know very little themſelues. So that I ſee no other effect of training men, then expenſe of time &amp; powder. And for mine owne part, I wiſh rather to haue men neuer exerciſed, then in this ſort trayned. But were they better trained then they are, yet are we not to put too great truſt in them. <hi>The Venetians making reckoning of the trayned men of their ſtate (which are ſuch like, as ours are) were abuſed</hi> (<hi>ſaith</hi>

                  <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> landed diuers times in <hi>Afrike</hi> during the warres with <hi>Carthage,</hi> and ſpoyled their townes and countrey: nay <hi>Caeſar</hi> landed his army in <hi>Epeirus,</hi> when the enemy with an army prepared helde all the Port townes.</p>

Who ſeeth not then howe eaſy it is to ſeaſe a Port, or to land in <hi>Spaine</hi> the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey being almoſt without garde of ſouldiers? if any man doubted before, yet ſince the voyage into <hi>Portugal,</hi> I thinke there is none will make queſtion of that matter. Neither did <hi>Scipio</hi> doubt for want of Portes, or friendes to ſayle into <hi>Afrike,</hi> or the <hi>Perſians</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> or other to inuade his enemy. For armes procure friendes, and winne Portes. ſo that had we no friends in <hi>Spaine,</hi> yet what reſoluce man would refuſe to goe againſt ſuch enemies? much more therefore nowe, ſeeing the <hi>Portugals</hi> are diſcontent with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> gouernment, and <hi>Spaine</hi> is ſo ſtored with men of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18564:62"/>foreine nations, and diuers malcontents.</p>
                  <p>As for the diſtance, it is nothing, where there is no reſiſtance by the way. And what reaſon haue we to accompt <hi>Spaine</hi> farre, when the <hi>Romanes</hi> doubted not to tranſport their armies not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into <hi>Afrike</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> but alſo into <hi>Aſia</hi> which is a farre lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cut. If winde and weather ſerue, in three dayes and three dightes the voyage may be perforified.</p>
                  <p>The difficulty of ſupplyes may eaſily be holpen with prouiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made beforehand.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18564:63"/>they be inuaded in their owne countrey both their reuenues will fayle, and their owne people not being exerciſed in warres, wil make but ſlender reſiſtance.

                  <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> inuading <hi>Sicile</hi> were ouerthrowen by the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and inſufficiencie of the Captaines, the diſorders of the ſouldiers, and want of things neceſſary. which may be remedied by diligent foreſight, prouiſion, and gouernement. But ſuppoſe ſome did miſcary in foreine warres, ſhall we therefore condemne that courſe? there is no reaſon, ſeeing as warres at home are not condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned becauſe many nations haue bene ſubdued and vanquiſhed in their owne countrey. Betwixt the <hi>Athenians</hi> or the <hi>Achaeans,</hi> &amp; this kingdome there is no compariſon in force or greatneſſe. But if the citie of <hi>Athens</hi> could ſubdue all <hi>Sicile</hi> except one onely citie: it is no ſuch difficult matter to inuade the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as is ſuppoſed.</p>
                  <p>Finally ſome in trembling maner demaund, what if ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie ſo farre caried away ſhould miſcary? which is a very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous point, for men to care more for thoſe mens liues that dee wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offer themſelues to the aduenture, then they doe themſelues: Seeing they dare venture nothing themſelues, yet let them not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie, and hinder others that will. But ſuppoſe the army ſhould miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary: yet would the loſſe be farre leſſe, then if ſo many ſhould be loſt at home. For here the ſequele would be great, there would be only loſſe of men: which God be thanked this countrey may well ſpare. But what ſimplicity is it to talke of looſing, where men goe with a reſolution rather to winne then looſe? neither <hi>Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> going in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor <hi>Scipio</hi> into <hi>Afrike</hi> caſt any ſuch doubt.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe nowe on the other ſide, that the <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſhould doe, that which hee once attempted, and God, more then our owne force would not ſuffer him to doe; and that an army of <hi>Spaniards</hi> were prouided to inuade vs: theſe things would fall out: not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the enemie will land, all the coaſt muſt be furniſhed with ſouldiers. For to thinke, that our trayned men would be trayned together in time to make reſiſtance, is ſimplicitie. And if any port be left open, as good all ſhould be diſarmed. But this would be double the charge of leuying and furniſhing an army for <hi>Spaine.</hi> and the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18564:63"/>longer the enemy holdeth vs in breath, the greater would the charge ariſe. and all this for any thing that I can ſee without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſeeing it is neither poſſible to keepe an army from landing, nor ſafety to fight without great aduantage immediatly vpon the enemies landing.</p>
                  <p>If the enemy ſhould land, as well he may comming with great force, we neither haue ſtrong townes, nor many great riuers to ſtoppe his proceedings, nor any way to reſiſt, but by force of men in open fielde, and howe dangerous it is to oppoſe yong ſouldiers and almoſt tumultuary forces againſt a puiſſant army of olde ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the victories of <hi>Annibal</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Afrike,</hi> of the <hi>Greekes</hi> in <hi>Perſia,</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and infinite Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries declare.</p>
                  <p>If the enemy be ſuffered to take breath, who ſeeth not howe hee will fortifie him ſelfe? if hee be ſuffered to range without fight, who conſidereth not the wracke and ſpoyles of the countrey that will folowe?</p>
                  <p>When the countrey is all in trouble, the reuenues both of the Prince, and priuate men either will ceaſe, or at leaſt be greatly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. <hi>Ferdinando</hi> king of <hi>Naples</hi> in the inuaſion of his State made by the <hi>French,</hi> found it<note n="23" place="margin">

And reaſon may teach vs, that where the huſbandmen part by the rapines of the enemy, and part by the ſpoyles of our owne ſouldiers can not enioy the fruites of their ground, their rentes can not be payde. and if rentes bee not payd, howe will our ſouldiers be payd? ſuppoſe then, that the charge of an army in a foreine countrey be great: yet may it well be borne, being equally diuided, ſo long as men enioy their liuings peaceably: if that may not be; howe ſhall we mainteine twiſe ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſouldiers at home?</p>
                  <p>If when the enemies inuade vs, malcontent perſons ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer themſelues, then as the number of our enemies, ſo the heape of our troubles would increaſe.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe (for what danger in ſuch a caſe is not to be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt?) that our army ſhould receiue ſome checke: what townes haue wee, or ſtraits to arreſt the enemy? the countrey people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnacquainted with warres, what lawes cankeepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in order? helpe can wee looke for none, our friendes being either not able, or not willing to helpe vs, for ſome ſeeme offended with the ſpoyles

                  <p>Firſt therefore wiſedome requireth, that they goe ſtrong. for that in foreine countreys they are no leſſe to feare the practices of double hearted friends, then the force of open enemies. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> when they ſent ayde to their friendes, neuer ſent leſſe then a full army, ſufficient to encounter the enemy. In ſending leſſe, either they ſhould not haue pleaſured their friends, or els haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangerd their owne men. Beſides this, it would haue bene diſhonor to the name of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> if either they had not bene able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the enemy, or willing to ſee their friendes long languiſh in feare, or their ſouldiers ouermatched, and not able to looke out into the fielde. For this cauſe being required ayde of the <hi>Campanians</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Samnites,</hi> of the <hi>Latins</hi> againſt the <hi>Volſcians,</hi> they ſent their Conſuls &amp; Generals forth with a mighty force, not only to driue
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18564:65"/>the enemie from the townes, but alſo to fight with him in the fielde. And taking vpon them the protection of the <hi>Sicilians</hi> againſt them of <hi>Carthage,</hi> they ſent thither ſufficient ſtrength both by ſea, and land.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Caeſar</hi> going in ayde of the <hi>Heduans,</hi> and other the confederates of the <hi>Romanes</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> oppreſſed by the <hi>Heluetians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Germans</hi> led with him a moſt braue army furniſhed with all things neceſſary. Neither was it the vſe of the <hi>Romanes</hi> only, but of all nations that vnderſtood the practiſe of armes, yea and of ours alſo.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Blacke Prince</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the third going into <hi>Spaine</hi> in ſuccour of <hi>Don Pedro de Caſtile,</hi> led thither a moſt flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing army, where with he ouerthrew the power of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the Ring to his ſeate. Likewiſe the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> in his expedition into <hi>Portugall,</hi> did not rely vpon the ayde of that nation, but caried with him a gallant army of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men. And when <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the fourth went into <hi>France</hi> to ayde the Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> be caried with him ſuch a power, as the heartes of the <hi>French</hi> trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſee it, and the king rather by money and rewardes, then by force ſought to cauſe them to returne. If the <hi>Romanes</hi> had ſent three or foure thouſand in ayde of their friendes in <hi>Sicile,</hi> or <hi>Greece,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> and ſo ſupplyed them by litle and litle: the opinion of their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and forces would neuer haue growen ſo glorious. Neither could the Prince of <hi>Parma</hi> of late times, if he had gone into <hi>France</hi> with a ſmall force haue deliuered his confederates from danger, or els broken the purpoſes of his enemies in that ſort hee hath. If then wee will not followe the ancient rules of warre, yet let vs not ſhewe leſſe iudgement and value in our proceedings, then our enemie.</p>
                  <p>Whoſoeuer therefore meaneth to winne honor in ſuccour of his friends abroad, let him as much as he can endeuour to cary with him a ſufficient force. Small numbers are neither eſteemed of enemies, nor friends. Into the field they dare not come, for they are too fewe and too weake, being penned vp in cities they famiſh. If our friends be ſtronger then our ayde, then are they commaunded by them. If any of their leaders want gouernement, our men that are put to all hard ſeruices, pay the priſe of their folly. If any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitie happen to their army, our people firſt feele it. They ſhift for them ſelues being in their owne countrey; ours are ſlayne
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18564:65"/>both of enemies and friendes, and if victuals waxe ſcant they ſterue firſt. I neede not ſhewe this by other examples, then by our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in <hi>France,</hi> and the Lowe countries.</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe that by our aide, our friendes ſhould be able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, or make peace with the enemy, yet are not our people more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red then before. When the Proteſtants in the firſt ciuil warres by the meanes of our forces had obteined that they would, or at leaſt tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conditions of peace, they ioyned with our enemies, to beſiege vs in <hi>Newhauen,</hi> and ſent vs away without reward or thankes. <hi>The Spaniards that had reſtored</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Guicciar. li. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Maximilian Sforza to the Duchie of Millan, the warres being ended for their reward, had like to haue had their throates cut.</hi> But they ſtood ſo much vpon their gard, that the practiſe of <hi>Hierome Moron,</hi> and the Marquis of <hi>Peſcara</hi> could take no effect. In ancient time howe often haue our people bene delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Dukes of <hi>Britaine,</hi> and <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in whoſe aide they went to venture their liues? and doe we thinke that the people of the Lowe countries, if once they be deliuered from the feare of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> will not turne out our garriſons, and vſe vs in like ſort? they will be able to doe it, and others haue done ſo before. Why then ſhould we thinke our ſelues priuiledged?</p>
                  <p>To aſſure our ſelues therefore of our friendes, the onely meanes is to haue a force ſufficient to maſter them, and correct their diſloyaltie. The ſame is the only courſe to preuaile againſt our enemies, to helpe our friendes, and mainteine our ſelues.</p>
                  <p>If that may not be obteined, I ſee not how our people can main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine their honor: but the next courſe to aſſure them ſelues, is to haue cautionary townes, or hoſtages, or both deliuered into their handes. townes, that they may aſſure them ſelues of retraite, in caſe of bad dealing; hoſtages, that they may be aſſured of their good dealing.

And thoſe that lodge without defence, or ſuffer any to come within them in the night, are open to euery enterpriſe of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>That they may both lodge, and march hard together, order is to be taken, that they may haue victuals deliuered them alwaies before hand; and that they be not driuen to ſeeke abroad for them. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the onely meanes of ſafetie is, neither to truſt enemy, nor friend: for none are abuſed, but they that truſt diſſoyall people.</p>
                  <p>If that our men can neither haue townes, nor hoſtages, nor victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, nor good vſage, what ſhould they be ſent among ſuch people? or why ſhould they truſt others, being not themſelues truſted? or why ſhould any ſuccour be ſent, but ſuch as may command, and puniſh the diſſoyall, and haue ſtrength to ſtand vpon themſelues?</p>
                  <p>Thoſe therefore that are gouernours (I truſt) they will maturely conſider of this point. if not, let them looke for this iſſue: if the enemy be ſtronger, then are our men either to be ſlaine, or famiſhed by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie: if by our forces our friendes preuaile, then for their rewarde ſhall they either be turned out of the countrey with diſgrace, or be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, or cut in peeces, by their friendes.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things conſidered, let vs nowe conſequently proceede to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, howe an army, after that it is exerciſed and furniſhed, and that the Generals haue all due conſiderations both therein, and in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prouiſion, and proceeding required before the marche of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, may march orderly, and ſafely.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He firſt care of him that meaneth to march ſafely in the enemies countrey, or where an enemie is neere, ought to be, that his troupes obſerue good order, and aray: and the neerer that he approcheth to the enemy, the greater
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18564:66"/>ought his care to be. The neglect of this point onely, hath bene the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of many armies. It giueth opportunitie to the enemy to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile vs, and confoundeth yong ſouldiers, when they are ignorant how to come in order to defend themſelues. Eaſie it is to be obſerued of men that are willing, and vnderſtand reaſon: and ſharpe effects and correction it worketh on the ſtubborne, and wilfull. That the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, or his officers may put the armie in good order of march, firſt they are to vnderſtand what is the aray of the whole armie, conſidered together as one whole body. Secondly, the places of euery part, as of horſemen, footemen, and of footemen, of the diuers ſortes of weapons. Thirdly, the iuſt diſtances of ſouldier from ſouldier, according to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mans qualitie and weapon. Fourthly, the places of the Generall, and other chiefe Commanders. Fiftly, of the great Ordonance, and munition. Laſtly, of the cariages and baggage, and boyes and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants that attend vpon it, and likewiſe of marchants, and victualers, and others that followe the army for other cauſes, then to fight.</p>
                  <p>The armie conſiſteth of three partes commonly, conſidered eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally as it marcheth. for in fighting, the orders, and parts doe much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer. The firſt part that marcheth wee call vantgard; the ſecond the battell; the third, the arier ward. Euery one of theſe ought to be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect body of it ſelfe, hauing both his ſmal ſhot, and great ordonnance, and his horſemen, and his pikes, targets, and halberds placed in good order. Oft times, I know, it is otherwiſe, and that either horſemen, or pikes, or targets are wanting in ſome part, or other. But howe much of theſe they want, ſo much they want of perfection, and due proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a iuſt army. For we ſpeake not of <hi>6</hi> or <hi>7</hi> thouſand (which cannot obſerue this order, but had better to march vnited) but of a ful army of <hi>24</hi> or <hi>30</hi> thouſand, which number marching in this order, ſo that one part may ſuccour an other, I accompt, doth march orderly, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If one part goe farre before an other, it may fall out, as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Proteſtants in the plaines of S. <hi>Clere anno 1569,</hi> that one part ſhall be in route, before the other can come to ſuccour. The <hi>Romanes</hi> marched diſtinguiſhed by legions, whoſe numbers were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and which ſeldome were complete: but in effect the aray was one; ſaue that the <hi>Romanes</hi> commonly made but two partes of their armie, and placed their baggage in the midſt, as did <hi>Caeſar</hi> marching againſt the <hi>Neruians.</hi> In the order of the partes, and placing of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and footemen, and ſorting of weapons, the ſame reaſons haue
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18564:67"/>place for the moſt part among all nations.</p>
                  <p>Before the auantgard, light horſemen by ancient preſcription may challenge the firſt place. If they be ſeconded with ſome ſhot and tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getters lightly armed, they may be the bolder to come neere the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and to abide his charge. Theſe are called <hi>auantcoureurs,</hi> and ſerue for diſcouery of the enemies proceedings, and of the ſituation of the Countrey, and intercepting of the enemies eſpials, and diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vſes. Vpon the front of the auantgard march ſmall ſhot and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetiers, after them follow the armed men with the enſignes in the midſt, or rather ſomewhat toward the firſt rankes. On either hand, and behind the armed men, are other companies of ſhot to be ranged; and without the ſhot ſomewhat auanced forward argoletiers, and then launces take their place. If the enemie make countenance, as if he would charge ſome part of our army with his horſe; they are to be drawne toward the ſide where the enemie threatneth to giue the charge. but if the enemie doe flie before vs, and ſhunne to fight, the horſemen of the whole armie would be ioyned together, and ſent to charge him on the ſides or backe, and to ſtay his marche: as <hi>Caeſar</hi> practiſed firſt againſt the<note n="a" place="margin">Caeſ. bel. Gal. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Heluetians,</hi> then againſt the<note n="b" place="margin">Caeſ. bel. Gal. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Aduati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans,</hi> and laſtly, againſt <hi>Petreius</hi> his<note n="c" place="margin">Caeſ. bel. ciu. 1.</note> armie in <hi>Spaine.</hi> By which meanes he ouertooke thoſe that were farre before him. But this hath vſe where we are ſtronger then the enemie in horſe. Howe many horſemen, or ſhot, or pikes, or targets, and other weapons ſhall march in a ranke, I referre to the iudgement of a good Sergiant maior, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the bredth of the waies, and approches of the enemie. The more doe march in a ranke, the leſſe paine he ſhall haue to ſet them in order, when he would place them in order of battell, and the ſtronger the aray is.<note n="d" place="margin">Guicciar. lib. 9.</note> Ten thouſand <hi>Switzers</hi> in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> in the warres betwixt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> marched foure ſcore in a ranke harde by the <hi>French</hi> armie, which ſeeing their reſolution, durſt not charge them.</p>
                  <p>The ſame courſe is to be taken in the aray of the battell, and arier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward marching, ſaue that theſe two partes following without any great diſtance betweene, neede not light horſemen or <hi>auantcoureurs,</hi> eſpecially where the enemie is before. Neither haue they ſuch vſe of ſhot or horſemen, as the auantgard, where they are vſed for ſupplies, rather then to fight in front.</p>
                  <p>In the placing of horſemen &amp; footemen, &amp; in ſorting and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:18564:67"/>of diuers weapons, ſo that euery ſort may doe beſt ſeruice, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth the ſpeciall iudgement of a wiſe leader. For therein are infinite differences, according to the diuers ſtrength of the enemie, and our owne forces; and likewiſe according to the diuerſities of grounds, and times. Yet commonly in marching this order is obſerued: firſt the light-horſe ſeconded if need be, with ſhot and targetters, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where the country is rough and wooddie, ſerue for <hi>auantcoureurs.</hi> Caliuers and muſquetiers are not onely to march on the front, but alſo on the ſides and backe of the armed men. Lances and men of armes are ranged, the outmoſt on the ſides for the moſt part. Next to the ſhot march the pikes of that part of the armie; theſe would bee ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged rather in battaillions according to the faſhion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that the ſhot and other light armed men might ſaue themſelues, and againe make head within the diſtances, then all in one front ioyned togither. But this is where the plainneſſe of the ground will giue leaue. In euery battaillion the enſignes are to bee placed ſomewhat toward the firſt rankes, garded with good ſtore of targetters and halberds well armed.</p>
                  <p>In placing and ſorting of weapons, the Generall is to conſider, that the charge of horſemen againſt ſhot and targetters is mortall, if they be not either garded with pikes, or haue the vantage of ditches, or hedges, or woods where they cannot reach them. In which caſe the ſhot gauleth the horſe, if they come within the leuell of the piece. Shot and targetters againſt pikes worke good effects: pikes ioined cloſe, and ſtanding firme togither, doe breake the carriere of horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: eſpecially where they haue their muſquetiers, placed neere by them. Archers, where they haue a defenſe before them, doe good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice in the field againſt horſemen. Theſe things let the General haue ſo in mind, that he may rather take the aduantage of weapons in the encounter, then giue it to the enemie.</p>
                  <p>In marching, the diſtances of euery ranke from ranke, and of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery ſouldier from his companion by him, are greater then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſtand ranged in battell readie to fight. It ſkilleth not much what the diſtance be, ſo they may beare their weapons commodiouſly, &amp; march ſeemelie: yet that euery man might know what diſtance is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, &amp; what is moſt ſeemly, it were good that one rule were obſerued. Shot, although in fighting they obſerue rather a courſe then aray, and are to ſtirre vp and downe to eſpie where they may hit the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie:
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18564:68"/>yet that they may with more eaſe and ſpeed bee drawen to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, are to march in diſtance from ranke to ranke fiue or ſixe foote, from ſhoulder to ſhoulder one foote, or a foote and a halfe. Argo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letiers or Piſtoliers, in march from horſe to horſe on the ſide, are diſtant two foote, from ranke to ranke a yarde and a halfe, or thereabout. The Lancier without bardes rideth in the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>Pikemen from their fellowes ſide by them, are diſtant a foote and a halfe, or two foote, from the pikemen behind and before, by reaſon of the length of their pikes twelue foote. Their march to their <hi>corps de gard,</hi> when they hold their pikes vpright, which the <hi>Italian</hi> calleth <hi>inalborar,</hi> is out of this rule. Of their diſtances in charging, or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the charge of horſe or foote, wee ſhall ſpeake when we come to the place.</p>
                  <p>Halbardiers march a foote and a halfe from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, and ſeuen foote from ranke to ranke. The targetter may obſerue the ſame diſtance from ſhoulder to ſhoulder, but hee needeth not ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from ranke to ranke.</p>
                  <p>The Generall, as he hath the commandement, ſo he ought to haue the care of all, and therefore ought to be in all places. But becauſe he cannot bee in all places at one time, therefore doeth the practiſe of warre require, that he aſſigne the guiding of his three battaillions, to three of his chiefe officers and commaunders, that are men of iudgement and experience, to ſee and commaund in his abſence all men in their battaillion to march in order. Himſelfe may march with the battell, vnleſſe for ſome cauſe it ſhall pleaſe him to march in the vantgard, or arierward. The <hi>Romanes</hi> ouer euery legion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of fiue or ſixe thouſand, placed a principall commaunder, they called him <hi>Legatum:</hi> the ſame was of the Generals counſell, and in his abſence one of his lieutenants. Euerie ſeuerall troupe of horſemen are to haue their ſeuerall commaunders, and euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine of ſhot likewiſe. All which ought to be obedient to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall of the horſe, or Colonell of the footemen, which know the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals counſell. The ſeuerall troupes alſo of armed men, are to haue their ſeuerall commaunders: prouided alwayes that no one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie haue more then one commaunder for auoiding of confuſion, and that euery of theſe hearken to their ſuperiours, which vnder the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall haue the chiefe gouernement of euery battaillion. The Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieant
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18564:68"/>maior, and corporals of the field his officers are to acquaint e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery commaunder with the Generals direction, which the ſame is to execute.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are therefore ſuffered to goe vp and downe to ſee things in order. For others it is not good they ſhould leaue their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raie, unleſſe it bee for neceſſarie cauſes, as ſickeneſſe, the neceſſities of nature, and ſuch like. The commaunders of euery troupe are to march in the head of their troupes, their lieutenants behind the ſame. All other colonels, captaines, lieutenants and ſerieants, are to keepe their ranke and araie wherein they ſhall be placed. For although ouer their priuate companies when they are ſingle they commaund; yet in the armie vnited togither, they are commaunded, and onely to ſee thoſe that follow them where they march to do their dueties. which conſent vnleſſe it be obſerued, theſe inconueniences will enſue. By contrarie commaundements, there will fall out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and contention: and many captaines, lieutenants, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieants will walke out of order, and much time will be ſpent in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of men in their places, which euery ſouldier ought to doe of himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The great ordonance being parted betwixt the vantgard, bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and rereward, ſometime is drawen in head of the<note n="a" place="margin">So was it at the battell of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contour, and in the battell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Conte Egmont and Thermes by Graueling.</note> pikes of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie battell: but for that it muſt needes trouble thoſe that would march on to fight with the enemie, farre better it were, if all the great ordonance were drawen on the ſides of the vantgard, as oft as the enemie made ſhew of charge, and then drawen vpon ſome hill, or ſome other place of aduauntage. In the field it doeth more trouble then ſeruice: the effectes of it, is but noyſe and foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie, onelie that ſmall townes ſhould not make reſiſtance, it is drawen along, and alſo for the vſe that it hath in ſieges, and bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries.</p>

                  <p>This is the common courſe, which is I thinke alſo beſt, for an armie to vſe in marching. But if the enemie make countenance, or rather doe begin to charge any part of the ſame: then that part which is neereſt him, is to be made the head or vantgard, the other two parts of the armie are to be drawen, the one on the right hand, the other on the left. If the enemie come on front, then the rankes of the auantgard are to bee doubled, or multiplied according to the capacitie of the ground. The battell and rierward are to be drawen vp, the one toward the left hand, the other toward the right, or els one part is to bee drawen vp vntill the ſame bee equall of front with the auantgard, and the other beyng deuided into battaillions, to ſerue for ſupplie where neede is.

                  <p>The aray of an army paſſing of riuers, is much according to the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18564:76"/>oppoſition made by the enemie: if none be made, the common order is ſufficient. If the enemie ſhe we himſelfe, the great ordonance is to be drawne to the banke on the ſides of the army, &amp; other ſhot likewiſe if they will reach ſo farre, to the entent the enemie may be forced to giue place. If the riuer be gueable, let the ſhot marche on the ſides, the tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets in front ſeconded with pikes: the horſemen may follow in the midſt. And when the other ſide is aſſured: then are the impediments, and great ordonance to be paſſed, the reſt of the army following after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the backe being armed, as the front. If the riuer be not to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at a forde, then a part of our army being ſent about to winne ſome more eaſie paſſage, when that is ready to come on the enemies backs, certaine boates with ſome ſmall pieces in the noſes of them, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with ſhot, and targets are firſt to ſet forward with equall front, and after them other boates laden with piquiers, are to folow: the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donance and impediments muſt come in the midſt, and the reſt of the army afterward.</p>
                  <p>But in paſſing of plaines, woods, ſtraites, mountaines, or riuers there is no courſe more effectual, then to vſe expedition &amp; celeritie. In all practiſes of warre the ſame is moſt auaileable. For by this meanes the danger is often paſſed, before the enemie be ready to withſtande vs.<note n="a" place="margin">Caeſ. bel. gal. 7.</note>

                  <p>If the enemie enter into a ſtrayte, which hath but two or three iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, take thoſe iſſues, and garde them ſtrongly, and thou haſt the enemie encloſed, as it were in a nette.

                  <p>The ſureſt defence againſt the enemies proceeding, is a riuer not to be forded ouer: but the bridges are to be broken, and the botes to be taken from the other ſide, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bankes where they are moſt lowe and eaſy to be rayſed with earth, and fenſed with ſtakes, and the ſame to be garded with a competent force both of horſemen, and footemen with their ſconces in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient places.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S in diuers other pointes, ſo in the lodging of our army wee are farre declined from the true practice of armes. The name of Campe remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, but the thing is quite decayed, and gone. Seldome doth the army lie in the field, vnleſſe it be in the ſieges of townes. Wherein notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we beſtow ſo many as we can in houſes, and villages. In marching for the moſt part, the companies are diſtributed in diuers villages, and that three or foure miles aſunder; if not more. The lodgings are ſeldome fenced, vnleſſe it be with a barriquade, or bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier, or ſmall trench ouerthwart the wayes. The watch is not ſo ſtrong, nor ſo diligent as it ſhoulde bee: the confuſion and noiſe is great: the prouiſion of things neceſſary very ſmall, and ſeldome other then the ſouldiers can finde. The which diſorders make the army to lie open to camiſadoes, and many enterpriſes, if the enemy be ſtrong and iudicious. For auoiding whereof the practiſe of warre requireth, that the army do reſt in no place but vnited, nor without ſufficient defence, and garde. Before that the practice of armes was brought to perfection, the army lodged, as nowe it doeth, without trenches or defenſes. <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> ſeeing the default therein, beganne firſt to fortifie his campe by entrenchment. Which the <hi>Romanes</hi> receiuing from him did in ſhort time excell their maſter. Onely bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18564:82"/>people commonly lay as before, open and without defence: which gaue the <hi>Romanes</hi> ſuch aduantage againſt them. And I doubt not, but if the right order of encamping were recalled by anie man of iudgement, that he ſhould haue like aduantage againſt theſe of our times. Many are the commondities that an army receiueth by their lodging well fortified. They fight not, but when they liſt, and ſee their aduantage: they ſleepe ſoundly without feare, and reſt ſafely without danger, <hi>ſuch</hi>

               <p>The forme of the campe is much according to the ſite and lying of the ground. Among the <hi>Romanes</hi> it was made for the moſt part foure ſquare. But it ſkilleth not though it bee three or fiue ſquare.

The deeper the ditch, and higher the banke is, the more aſſured is the defence. At euerie corner eſpecially towardes the enemy there woulde bee made a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bulwarke or platforme ſomewhat auanced from the cortine of the campe for the placing of the great ordonance, for defence of the ditch and cortaine, and clearing of the grounde wythout the campe. In the ſides there woulde bee lefte two great
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18564:85"/>paſſages, or iſſues for the army to enter and iſſue; and two leſſer on the outſides for the neceſſarie vſes of the campe.</p>
               <p>The compaſſe is according to the number of the armie, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tenne foote ſquare for euery horſeman, and foure foote ſquare for euery footeman or thereabouts. There are to be left foure broade ſtreetes in the place, for the paſſing and repaſſing of ſouldiers; and for the commoditie of victuallers, and Marchantes a market place.</p>
               <p>The Generall ought to pitch his tent in the middeſt of the camp, about him are his Gentlemen and garde to bee placed, if there bee not place ſufficient for them in his tents. The horſemen are to be quartered in the middeſt of the camp, for that they are moſt vnreadie if any ſodaine aſſault ſhould happen; but in ſome conuenient ſquare for the beauty of the campe. The ſhot and archerie are to haue their tentes next to the ring of the campe round about the ſame: within them are the halbardiers, targettiers, and other ſhort wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons to haue their quarter aſſigned: and betwixt them and the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the pikes. So that euery man may know both where to lodge directly, and what place to goe vnto, if the enemy doe charge vs. The waſte places remayning are to bee aſſigned to the carriages, and the boyes, and ſeruants that followe the campe. For flaughter of beaſts and neceſſities of nature there are two places to bee aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, eyther in ſome out place of the campe, or without the campe. The whole diſtance and compaſſe is rather with the iudgement of the eye, then with Geometricall inſtruments to bee caſt out.

               <p>The way to weary the enemy without fight is, firſt with an army conſiſting moſt of horſemen, ſhot, targets, and halberdiers lightly armed, to coaſt him a farre off: next to ſpoyle the countrey where hee paſſeth, and to bring all the cattell, corne, and prouiſion that may any way ſerue his turne into ſtrong townes: thirdly to ſtore the townes of warre with prouiſion, and aſſure them with ſtrong garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; fourthly to cut the bridges ouer great riuers, and to ſeaſe all narow and ſtraite paſſages.

To part a ſmall number into ſo many partes, as we doe a full armie, were rather to breake it, then orderly to part it; and a matter in ſhewe ridiculous. If the enemies force be greater on the corners then in the midſt, we muſt haue conſideration of that in framing and ranging our army. Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men

The ſupply would be neere ſo many, as the front. but it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if the laſt hope be halfe ſo many. The diſtances of the ſupply would be greater, then of the battaillions in front, which charging the enemy, are to ioyne cloſe together, and being wearied may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire within the diſtances of the ſupply. which two partes ioyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, do then make one front. if both be foiled, then are they to be receiued within the diſtances of the laſt hope, which are largeſt, and all the partes to vnite their whole forces together. If any doubt of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18564:94"/>the confuſion that may ariſe in the retiring of the firſt and ſecond bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell backe to the third, then may the ſupply, and laſt hope be drawen vp vpon the ſides: which will worke the very ſame effects.</p>
                  <p>In the midſt of euery battaillion or ſquare, ſomewhat toward the firſt rankes, would the enſignes be placed with their garders well ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and furniſhed with ſhort weapons.</p>
                  <p>Euery battaillion would haue his ſeuerall leader, which would be the firſt man of the right hand in the firſt ranke of the ſquare. for that the inferior leaders in a maine battell ſhould ſtand out of ranke, is contrary to practiſe of warres. If in euery battaillion there were ſome part targetters contrary to the moderne vſe, there might be good vſe made of them, when the armies come to ioyne, both againſt ſhot and pikes.</p>

Liu. 38.</note>Before the front of the battell are certeine troupes of ſhot to take their ſtanding, which may not onely defend the head of our army: but alſo anoy whoſoeuer offereth himſelfe to the charge. If they be preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with horſemen or targetters, their retreit is within the diſtances of the battaillions, if the ground affoord them no other defence. From thence they are to be drawen eftſoone againe, and employed where theyr leaders ſhall perceiue they may doe moſt ſeruice. A ranke of moſquetiers vnder the firſt ranke of pikes may doe good ſeruice, if they be drawen into the diſtances when the enemy commeth to the charge.</p>
                  <p>The horſemen, if they be not ſtrong enough to encounter the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies horſe, would be ſeconded with certeine troupes of ſhot and halfe pikes. but diligently are they to take heed, that they goe not directly before the front of their owne footmen, leſt retiring thence, they fall vpon their owne pikes. The great ordonance, if there be any hill in the place, either on the right hand or left hand of the army, is there beſt placed, both for ſeeing of the enemy, and for feare of diſordering our men, either going to the charge, or retiring backe. If the ground be euen, it is placed in the head of our army a little before our troupes of ſhot. which after the ſame is diſcharged, auance themſelues, while that is drawen within the diſtances either of the battaillions, or of the midbattell and corners. For defence of the artillery there are good gardes to be appointed, whereſoeuer it ſtandeth.</p>
                  <p>If this order cannot be obſerued: yet this rule is generally to be reſpected, that euery weapon, and ſouldier is there to be placed, where
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18564:94"/>he may moſt anoy the enemy, and beſt defend himſelfe. The partes are ſo to be placed, that one may ſuccour another, and one retire to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Horſemen may not come within the ground of the footmen, nor ſhot within the rankes of pikes, but both either on the ſides, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde the battaillions. He is moſt iudicious, that can bring moſt men to fight, and ſtop the way to the enemy, that he can not extend his men to hurt him. There is no company to be ſent forth to ioyne with the enemy, but with ſome to relieue them againe, and againe, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them retiring, and ſtop the enemies purſute. Horſemen may not charge pikes, nor come in ground where they cannot fetch their carriere. Other rules in their ſpeciall places ſhall be preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>Shot in marching and ſtanding obſerue order. The diſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue ſhewed. In fighting they obſerue no order, but euery man marking his enemy right before him, and ſhooting at him ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his beſt aduantage. yet if they obſerue not a certeine courſe where the ſhot are many, they ſoone fall in diſorder. Archers for that they ſhoot and fight ſtanding in ranke, obſerue better aray. their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from ſhoulder to ſhoulder is one foot, from ranke to ranke foure foot. Some now a dayes doe little eſteeme this weapon: yet if our archers were armed with plated iackes as in time paſt, neither ſhotte could abide them in euen ground, nor pikes without ſhotte. Againſt horſemen, where they may finde defence of hedges, or ditches, or ſtakes, or rough ground they do very good ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Pikemen againſt a charge of horſemen ought to ſtand cloſe with the blunt end of the pike in the ground, the poynt bent vpon the horſe breſt. Ranke from ranke ſtandeth not more then three foot aſunder, that many endes of pikes may garde the firſt ranke. That the pikes may be commodiouſly bent and croſſed, the firſt rankes are to bow theyr bodies. that they may the better breake the charge of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies horſe: before them they are to haue a ranke of moſquetiers, as hath bene ſaid already.</p>
                  <p>Where the pikemen go to charge other pikes, betweene ſhoulder and ſhoulder, there would be a foot diſtance; betwixt ranke and ranke ſo much, as charging with the pikes aboue hand, and breaking the ſame they may vſe theyr ſwordes, and daggers, and either in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king auance forward theyr right legges, or els receiuing the enemies blowes draw backe the ſame. Sixe foot I thinke for that purpoſe to be ſufficient.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:18564:95"/>
                  <p>The halberdieres, bilmen, and targetters would haue likewiſe betwixt ſhoulder and ſhoulder one foot, betwixt ranke and ranke fiue foot. In pikes and ſhort weapons this is generally to be obſerued, that they ſtand as cloſe together as may be, ſo they may haue roome to manage themſelues, and their weapons. the leſſe roome may ſerue, conſidering that I would haue all ſouldiers to ſtrike with the point of their weapon: and euery man to ſuccour his fellowes before him, and on the ſides.</p>
                  <p>The horſemen go to the ſhocke with equall front ſo neere as they can, and runne ſo cloſe ſide by ſide as they may without hurt ech to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If horſe be diſtant from horſe two foot, and ranke from ranke ſeuen foot, when horſemen goe trotting to the charge, the proportion is good. The aray of the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> that charge with ſingle rankes is of no ſtrength: neither the orders of the <hi>Reiters</hi> that goe to the charge in a ring. for ſo ſoone as they are inueſted with lances, they are broken. and therefore I thinke the former aray better, as vſed both by antiquity, and the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> caualery, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth ground at this day to no other.</p>
                  <p>The ancient leaders of time paſt, which for their ſkill in armes are famous to poſterity, howſoeuer in ſome circumſtances they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from theſe rules; yet neuer did they neglect the Generall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of them. neither ought they to be neglected of any, as I will make manifeſt by particulars.</p>

                  <p>When the duke of <hi>Burgundie</hi> was to fight with <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11, at <hi>Montlehery,</hi> hee placed his archers firſt: but becauſe his <hi>caualery</hi> was not placed on the ſides, but behinde: the ſame, going to the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18564:100"/>charge, ouerranne his owne men, and killed diuers of them, and fewe or none of the enemies. In which diſorder if <hi>Lewis</hi> had charged him, he could not haue failed of the victorie.</p>
                  <p>The Prince of <hi>Condè Anno 1567</hi> remayning at <hi>S. Denys,</hi> and vnderſtanding the Kings determination to driue him thence: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in the fieldes betwene <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>S. Denys</hi> to receiue the charge in this order: he diuided his horſemen into three partes, and did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond euery part with ſhot: with the reſt of the ſhot <hi>Ienlis</hi> beganne the charge. Footemen armed which are the ſtrength of the army he had none. The partes were ſo farre ſundred, that one part could not ſuccour another. So that if the armed men of the aduerſe party had come on: both the horſemen, and footemen of the Prince had bene driuen to a poore retraite. The Conſtable hauing <hi>16000</hi> foote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, brought fewe or none to the encountre. Of this number <hi>6000 Suitzers</hi> were there planted in the fielde, like ſo many ſtakes, without giuing any one blow that day.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Moncontour</hi> the Admiral placed firſt his<note n="a" place="margin">They are the moſt part Piſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leers on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe.</note> 
                     <hi>Reyters,</hi> and ſide by them certaine lances: both theſe hee fenſed on the ſides with ſhot: behinde theſe he placed a ſquadron of <hi>Lanſquenets</hi> flanked likewiſe with ſhot, and ſeconded with ſome fewe horſemen, all which made the Auantgard. The battell conſiſted of ſhot which was likewiſe flanked, and ſeconded with ſhot. In the head both of the battell, and Auantgard were certaine ſhot placed, as <hi>enfans perdus</hi> (wee call them the forlorne hope) in which aray there was neither order, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, nor ſtrength. There wanted armed men in the battell. Horſemen coulde not, being ſo placed come to the charge, but they ſhould runne ouer their owne men. In ſome they were ſo placed, that not the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred perſon could come to fight. But percaſe the Admirall either coulde not doe as hee would, or elſe carried away with the errour of the <hi>French,</hi> that put all in ſhot, had more of that weapon, then coulde doe ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>The enemies Auantgard at the ſame time ſtood vpon <hi>4000 Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> flanked with certaine Regiments of ſhot: before the <hi>Suitzers</hi> were <hi>8</hi> fielde pieces placed, and before the pieces the forlorne hope: beyonde the ſhot were ranged certaine lances. The battell being drawne vp, and ranged in equal front with the Auantgard, in faſhion differed little, or nothing from the ſame. Much like courſe, ſure no better hath bene vſed in all the battels that haue bene fought ſince
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18564:100"/>the inuention of artillery. So that we ſee how all wiſe captaines, do goe about in their arayes to reſemble the proceeding of ancient time, but there is not now the like vnion of the parts, nor the like ſtrength of the whole body, nor that orderly proceeding, that euery weapon may doe his office, nor that proportion of the front, nor order of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that were among ancient warriers. And by reaſon of vnifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in proceeding now wanting, hard it is to ſet men in order: hard to bring many to fight, and hardeſt of all to reſtore an array once bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. this is the cauſe of the weakneſſe of the armies of ourtime: in diſorder no army can fight, nor reſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore of two things in this point conſiderable, let vs doubt neither.

A matter of great importance, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage, if it be well conſidered: and therefore not to be omitted. You that knowe the traine of armes, yeelde here the teſtimonie of your experience to this diſcourſe, and if you heare any cauill againſt it, yet let not ſuch as neuer marched further, then out of the kitchin, or from the dreſſer into the hall, or parlour, cenſure that which they vnderſtand not.</p>
                  <p>Horſemen among the <hi>Romanes</hi> were al of one ſort: barded horſes with men all armed mounted on them they vſed not. If they vſed any archers on horſebacke, they were beholding to other natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for them. Nowe vſe of late times hath brought in diuers ſortes of them, which according to their armes and furniture haue diuers names. Some horſe are barded, others without bardes. The <hi>Frenchmen</hi> of armes in time paſt vſed barded horſes for feare of our arrowes. Nowe ſince archerie is not ſo much reckoned of, and bardes are but a weake de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt ſhotte, lanciers leauing their bardes, are armed much like to the <hi>Albanian</hi> ſtradiots. Vpon the borders betwixt vs, and the <hi>Scots,</hi> horſemen haue ſtaues for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purpoſe, and for their armes iackes of male. The <hi>Dutch Reitres</hi> although well armed for the moſt part, yet ſeldome vſe lances, or ſtaues, or other weapon, then piſtoles, and mazes at their ſaddle bowe. Beſide theſe, there is an other ſort of horſemen lately come in vſe. We call them carbines, pedrinals, or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goletiers, which vſe firelocke peeces on horſebacke, and are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly armed to the proofe of their piece.</p>
                  <p>Horſemen in warres are moſt neceſſary in diuers reſpects. With them we range and ſpoile the enemies countrey: with them we fetch in victuals for our ſelues: with them we diſcouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: with them we bridle his courſes, and ſtop his forragers: with them we both helpe to foyle him in open fielde, and purſue him flying from vs.<note n="a" place="margin">Caeſ. bel. gal. 7.</note>

                  <p>In fighting with the enemie, there are diuers vſes of horſemen. If we charge him on the ſides, or backe: we ſtop his march, as before I haue ſhewed.

Horſemen therefore in all expeditions I accompt very requiſite for the cauſes aboue rehearſed, and for that without them, albeit we could foyle the enemie, <hi>yet we cannot kill many, nor preuaile againſt him, that is ſwifter of foote then we, as</hi>

This may ſerue thoſe that are inferior to the enemy, in horſemen. For this nation I truſt this diſcourſe is needeleſſe. For albeit we haue hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto had great want of horſemen in our expeditions in <hi>France, Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Portugal:</hi> yet there is no reaſon, that this land ſhould want hereafter, hauing ſuch meanes.

                  <p>Lances, and Carbines haue like vſe in following the victory, and chaſe. But while the enemy ſtandeth, lances are beſt employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſhot, and carbines againſt pikes. But yet muſt they take heed, how they do inueſt them. In diſcouering the enemy, and fetching in of victualles, and brideling the enemies forragers, both lances, and carbins, and archebuziers on horſebacke would be ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But carbins, and argoletiers are to take heede that they come not neere the lances of the enemy, leſt they make holes in their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſides, if no worſe. Where the enemy is in diſorder there al ſorts of horſemen may do ſeruice. At <hi>Ceriſoles</hi> after that the ſhot had made way in the enemies battell, the <hi>French</hi> entred with their horſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and ouerthrew them.</p>
                  <p>Pikes are the onely defence of footemen againſt horſemen, if they be taken in plaine ground. Yet doe I not thinke it good, that there ſhould be ſuch numbers of pikes in our armies, as is vſed. For that vſe excepted, which I ſpake of, I ſee no other great profite they haue.

                  <p>The <hi>Switzers</hi> that are for the moſt part piquiers, will not march anie whither without their companies of ſhot attending on them, for their garde.

A ſmall number of targetters if once they come to reach ſhot with their ſwordes, put great numbers of them out of the field.

                  <p>Targettiers in execution are ſingular, and ready, and light, if their targets be light, in following the chaſe. They may be vſed in all ſeruices and all groundes.

                  <p>Halberds and blacke billes, pertiſans, boreſpeares, and pollaxes, and all ſuch like weapons to be vſed in hand, haue one and the ſame vſe with ſwordes and targets. But neither are the men that vſe them ſo well defended againſt ſhot and pikes, nor is that ſort of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſo effectuall. If the enemy giue ground they are proper for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; and may be employed in open field, in ſtraites, in woodes, in aſſaultes, ſallies, and many ſeruices. Their armes are eyther corſalets, and gorgerons, or plated doublets, or iackes with ſkirts
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18564:107"/>for defence of the thighes, and morrions on their heades. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> vſed few of theſe weapons. The <hi>Dutch</hi> place diuers rankes of them among their pikes, and commonly they are planted by the enſignes.</p>
                  <p>The ſhot is diuided into moſquetters, caliuers, and archers. The vſe of ſhot is diuers. In open field therewith wee defend our pikes, and with the ſame offend the enemies pikes. Where the ſame hath a defence againſt the force of horſemen, it is verie profitably em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed againſt them. In the defence of a towne, forte, or paſſage, it is excellent. Likewiſe for the aſſailantes therewith to cleare the walles while their armed men mount by breach, or by ſcale. But the ſame muſt take heede of the force of the horſe, and charge of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med men, which without defence of pikes, or other naturall wall, or banke, the ſame cannot ſuſtaine. The force of ſhot is greater in ſkirmiſh, then in ſet battelles. For ſhot if they bee driuen to ſtand thicke haue no vſe. As the vnprofitable number of ſhot at the battell of <hi>Moncontour,</hi> and <hi>Dreux:</hi> and other incounters in the late warres of <hi>France,</hi> declare ſufficiently.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18564:108"/>For being armed with iackes, as they ſhoulde bee, when they come to gripes, they driue the ſhot to his feete: and ſhooting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie rankes one ouer an others head twelue arrowes ſhall fall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one boullet.

All which I yeelde to be true, in ſuch an enemie as flieth without purpoſe to returne, and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:18564:115"/>which cannot be broken without great danger. But if he purpoſe to returne, no danger is to be refuſed, nor labour to be ſhunned, that he may be broken: which in deede is no difficultie. For he that cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt whole, can euill reſiſt broken. And therefore this is a controuerſie, without firme reaſon of the contrary cauſe. Yet in purſuing the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, I would not haue him ſo ſtopped, but that he may flie, nor would I haue deſperate men fought withall: but I would haue them with hunger, and diſeaſe, forced to accept of their liues, and ſo yeelding their armes to depart. Which if the <hi>French</hi> had practiſed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of <hi>Naples,</hi> they had not ſo ignominiouſly bene driuen out thence, by <hi>3</hi> or <hi>4</hi> thouſand <hi>Biſognos,</hi> that they ſuffered to neſtle in <hi>2</hi> or <hi>3</hi> out townes of the Countrey.</p>

                  <hi>courage of the Volſcians was ſo cooled, after their ouerthrowe by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, that they yeelded their citie for feare, without any force.</hi> Therefore <hi>Scipio,</hi> after the ouerthrowe of <hi>Annibals</hi> army, brought his forces preſently before <hi>Carthage,</hi> which he draue to accept of compoſition.

                  <hi>Scipio ſaid, it is a matter of more time,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:18564:115"/>then labour.</hi> For where the Countrey is ſpoiled, no townes can long holde out. But that may be done eaſily, where an army goeth vp and downe victorious without ſtoppe, or encounter. The reaſon that the townes of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> haue ſo long holden out againſt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is, that they haue both the ſea open, and many good friends and fauours in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A victorious army not only taketh whatſoeuer towne it beſiegeth, but alſo ſeaſeth the whole countrey. <hi>Annibal</hi> after the victory at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> poſſeſſed a good part of <hi>Italy.</hi> After the ouerthrow of their forces by <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>Afrike,</hi> the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> could not ſay, that they had any one towne remaining in obedience. After <hi>Caeſars</hi> victorie at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexia,</hi> almoſt all <hi>France</hi> yeelded it ſelfe vnto him: ſo well did he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the victorie againſt <hi>Pompey</hi> in <hi>Epeirus,</hi> againſt <hi>Scipio</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frike,</hi> againſt <hi>Afranius</hi> and <hi>Pompeyes</hi> ſonnes in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that with one victorie he aſſured himſelfe of the whole Countrey, and with one enemie fought no more, but once. The <hi>French</hi> by one victorie recouered all the kingdome of <hi>Naples,</hi> and by one ouerthrowe at <hi>Gariglian,</hi> loſt it againe. <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt, by his victorie at <hi>Marig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan,</hi> came in poſſeſſion of moſt of the Duchie of <hi>Millain,</hi> being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowne and taken at <hi>Pauy,</hi> he loſt the ſame againe. The Earle of <hi>Warwike,</hi> after one victorie in the daies of <hi>Henrie</hi> the ſixt, aſſured all <hi>England</hi> to his Prince. <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, by one victorie recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame againe: and if that our anceſtors had well followed the victories at <hi>Creſſy, Poytiers,</hi> and <hi>Agincourt,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> had not ſo eaſily diſpoſſeſſed them of their holde in <hi>France.</hi> But what can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not delaies, want of ſupply, and diuiſion worke in ſuch caſes? Firſt therefore, the armie that is victorious, ought not to ſuffer the enemie to gather head, but to ſcatter his forces. Secondly, the ſame ought to beſiege the chiefe Citie, and to ſeaſe the Countrey into their handes, not ſuffering the enemie in any place to reſt. The <hi>French</hi> king after his victorie at <hi>Moncontour,</hi> beſieging S. <hi>Iean d'Angeli,</hi> loſt there the vigour of his armie, which might better haue bene emploied about <hi>Rochel.</hi> Thirdly, the Generals care ought to be, howe to take away the enemies ſubiects from them, and to depriue them of the aide of their confederats. A matter not difficult, if he proceede wiſely in warre, and iuſtly after the victorie. for as good ſucceſſe procureth to the Conquerour friends, ſo euery one abandoneth, and contemneth the vanquiſhed.

                  <hi>Capuans,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Italy,</hi> reuolted from the <hi>Romanes</hi> after the infortunate encounter at <hi>Cannae. Philip</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ouercome by <hi>Titus Quintius,</hi> not onely ſawe the departure of his confederates, and friendes; but alſo the rebellion of his owne ſubiects. After that the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſide began to decline in their warres with the <hi>Romanes;</hi> all their friendes forſooke them. The ſame diſloyall dealing of ſubiects and friendes, <hi>Charles</hi> laſt Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> felt after his diſaſtrous iourney againſt the <hi>Switzers</hi> at <hi>Granſon.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Comines</hi> taketh occaſion to tell a long tale, howe dangerous it is for a Prince to be ouercome in a pight fielde: at which if he had knowne ancient hiſtories, he would not haue made ſuch wonderment. For there neuer was, nor can be other ſucceſſe looked for in ſuch caſes. Wherefore after the victorie, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall is to practiſe with the friendes, and confederates of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, and with good conditions to vnite them vnto him ſelfe. Heerein the opinion of the iuſtice, and good dealing of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſhall greatly further his deſire; as is euident by the example of <hi>Scipio,</hi> and <hi>Annibal.</hi> For <hi>Scipio</hi> ſending vnto euery Citie in <hi>Spaine,</hi> thoſe pledges which the enemie had from them, and which he had taken from the enemie; he gotte him ſelfe much friendſhippe: and <hi>Annibal</hi> after his victorie, diſmiſſing ſuch of the aſſociats of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> as he had taken without ranſome, and vſing them courteouſly, procured him ſelfe amongeſt them great credite of good dealing; ſo that many did adhere vnto him, and forſake the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.</hi>

               <p>Thus we ſee howe the victorie is to be purſued. Nowe therefore let vs ſee howe our conqueſt may be mainteined, and aſſured.

               <p>The kings of this realme peopling <hi>Caleis</hi> with Engliſh, kept the ſame long in their poſſeſſion, which they loſt not, but by force. If they had likewiſe peopled <hi>Rochel, Poitiers, Limoges, Burdeaux,</hi> and other townes with this nation; they would not haue bene ſo hard to keepe, nor readie to reuolt. not doing that, they did ſoone looſe the ſame by treaſon. And if Colonies had now of late bene ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Ireland,</hi> not as now ſcattering and diſunited, and few in number, but in good ſtrength and vnited by lawes, and dwelling in townes as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did, I doubt not, but the countrey would bee better aſſured, and the charge farre leſſer then now it is. For the charge of garriſons is great, the inſolencie of garriſon ſouldiers greater. And if an enemie come againſt them, their ſtrength is nothing. If any man ſay, that it is hard to diſpoſſeſſe the ancient inhabitants of the countrey out of their dwellings: he conſidereth not that rebels, and enemies are ſo to bee vſed; and that if they bee placed other where, it is of mercie rather then deſert, which notwithſtanding in all caſes may not bee vſed.

               <p>To maintaine a force therfore without great charge, the meane is to ſend Colonies of the Engliſh nations into the country conquered. But foraſmuch as both garriſons, and ſometimes greater forces are required for defence of it; the rentes of diuers cities, countreys and grounds are that way to bee imploied. And to this end the fruits of the roialties are to be conuerted, and corne and prouiſion to be laid vp in ſtorehouſes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> taking that courſe, did in all places where they commaunded, finde meanes to maintaine their armies without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie great exactions, yea oftentimes the fruites of the countrey were ſo great, that beſide that charge there came much to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like treaſurie.</p>

               <p>It is a matter very difficult for an armie that is broken to rallie it ſelfe, and depart without vtter diſcomfiture where the enemie know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it, and vſeth his aduantage.

               <p>Thoſe therefore that retire, Iet them marche reſolutely, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly: the ſhot let them approch neere to the flanks of the ſquadrons of pikes. There alſo is the defence of targetters againſt horſe. The
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:18564:119"/>pikes let them not diſdeine the helpe of ſhot, and ſhort weapons. The horſe are to bee ranged behinde the ſquadrons, or on the flankes. Which if they be vnited in one body are not eaſily broken, nor raſhly to be charged.</p>
               <p>If being neere the enemy thou deſireſt to depart without fight, at leaſt without Ioſſe, thy beſt courſe is to make him vncertaine of thy purpoſe, by pretending that which thou meaneſt not. By making of fires, hauging of matches in buſhes, and ſtanding of tentes, the enemy is oftentimes abuſed, eſpecially in the night. That thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies may make more ſpeede, thou art before thou beginneſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge, to ſende thy hurt and ſicke, together with the baggage and great ordonance before thee, and then to followe with the reſt.<note n="a" place="margin">Sauciorum &amp; aegrorum habita ratione impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta omnia ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio prima no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte ex caſtris A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polloniam prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit, Ac con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcere ante iter confectum vetuit, his vna le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio praeſidio miſſa eſt.

                  <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar departing from Pompey at Dyrrhachium, that he might not be charged at diſaduantage in his marche, tooke this courſe. The ſicke, hurt, and baggage of the campe hee ſent away firſt garded with one Regiment. Other Regiments he cauſed to marche after them ſome good diſtance: with two legions that remained hee followed laſt.</hi> And hauing marched ſo much as he meant to doe that day, and making ſhewe to lodge there, when the enemy, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed was not aware, and vnreaby, hee departed preſently, and that day got ſo much ground, that after ward hee ould neuer be ouertaken, before hee came whither hee meant to goe. If the enemy be ready in armes to follow, it is hard to goe from him, vnleſſe the neereneſſe of hils, or ſtraites doe fauour thy retraite.</p>
               <p>Leſt thou be charged in retiring, with the enemies horſe or ſhot, or diſordered in ſome ſtraite; great care muſt be vſes. To repreſſe the force of horſemen, vſe either thy horſemen entermingled with ſome ſhot, or ſquadrons of pikes flanked with muſquetiers: againſt ſhot, vſe horſemen in the plaine, and ſhot and targetters in ſtraites. If thou feareſt to be charged in ſome ſtraite, take the vpper ground with thy ſhot, and targets, and ſeeke thoſe aduantages which before I haue ſhewed thee in the diſcourſe of the vſe of diuers weapons, and aduantages of ground.</p>
               <p>To ſtoppe the enemies purſuite, where he muſt paſſe a ſtraite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be come at thee, it is a good courſe to cut downe trees and woods, and to ſet them on fire.

For without them, thou canſt neither commodiouſly cary armes, nor victuals with thee, nor mainteine thy company.</p>
               <p>To do whatſoeuer in this caſe is requiſite, nothing is more auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, then expedition. By that thou diſpatcheſt all impediments, thou winneſt ground, thou preuenteſt the enemy, thou ſaneſt thy ſelfe, and thy friends.

               <p>Theſe things they hinder and ſtoppe the enemies proceeding for ſometime. But if thou meaneſt to driue him out of the countrey, or to hinder him for winning any more ground; newe forces muſt be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied, and an army ſent into the fielde, if not to fight with him vpon eauen grounde: yet to watche all aduantages, and to ſuccour where neede ſhall require.

               <p>Finally, as all calamities, ouerthrowes, and miſhaps do proceed from contempt of religion, iuſtice, and military diſcipline; ſo there is no hope to repaire our loſſes, but by reſtoring the worſhip of God, by adminiſtring of good iuſtice, and ſtrict obſeruance of military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

               <p>Of townes therefore that do make reſiſtance againſt vs, thoſe are firſt to be beſieged, where the General of the enemies is retired with his forces: if he be gone farre away: then we are next to beſet thoſe townes, which for their authority, or conuenient ſituation do cary with them the reſt of the countrey: and if warres be ſo managed, that our forces will not ſerue both to beſiege the capitall city of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and to repreſſe the courſes of our enemies intercepting our vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualles, then are we to go on forward orderly in the countrey, and to leaue no towne behinde vs, that may ſtop the conueyance of our victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles. <hi>Caeſar</hi> purſuing <hi>Vercingetorix</hi> made him take <hi>Alexia</hi> for his retrait, and there beſieged him. <hi>Annibal</hi> to terrify the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and to enforce them to ſubmit themſelues to the empire of the <hi>Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, aſſaulted, tooke, and ſackt</hi>

So likewiſe townes beſieged are to be enuironed with bankes, and trenches, and with the ſame our campe is likewiſe to be fenced. The vſe of the ſea is to be taken from them with ſhippes, as <hi>Marcellus</hi> did in the ſiege of <hi>Syracuſae,</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> in the ſiege of newe <hi>Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Vtica.</hi> If the ſame ſtand vpon riuers, the ſame are to be barred with bridges, as<note n="a" place="margin">Liu. 2.</note>

               <p>If the Towne be ſtrong, and hard to be forced, the ſafeſt way is to proceede by ſiege, and ſurpriſe: if in iudgement of men experiemented the Towne be weake, and eaſie to be forced, he looſeth time that ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth about it, that by force may enter it. Thoſe Townes I accompt hard to bee forced, whereunto eyther for height, or for water, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inconuenience the ſouldier canne hardly come. A Towne ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate vpon a rocke which is well walled, and flanked, can hardly be aſſaulted. For ſuch grounde can neither bee mined, nor trenched.</p>

               <p>Other Townes that are placed in eauen ground and good ſoyle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be ſtrongly fortified, yet either by breache, or ſcale, or mine may be entred, eſpecially where the ſouldiers are neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, nor ſkilfull, nor reſolute. Of ſuch Townes that are neither well flanked, nor well manned, there is no doubt to be made, but that by a reſolute charge they may be wonne.</p>
               <p>The courſe that is commonly and beſt to be vſed in aſſaulting of Townes is this: after that the Generall commeth in viewe of the Town, that he determineth to aſſault, let him ſend his campe-maſter, or ſome other ſpeciall mea of iudgement before with his horſemen, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded with ſhot, and targets, to viewe the walles of the Towne, and the ground without the Towne, where the batterie may moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly be made, by reaſon of the weakenes of the walles, or ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uennes of the ground. If he cannot approche with his horſe, he may then vſe his ſhot, and targets, to beate thoſe that wil offer themſelues to hinder the diſcouery. That he faile not in iudgement, he is to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that where the walles are hie, or weake, or deſtitute of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, or flankers, and the ditche is narrowe, and drie, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground within and without plaine and eauen; there is a good place to make a batterie. Yea albeit the wall be ſtrong and well flanked, yet if there be no weaker place, I would not haue him doubt to chuſe that place to plant his artillery in. If by eſpials we vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d where y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground, and the defenſes of the Towne giue vs beſt commoditie to make a breache, then there needeth no great viewe, but onely to ſee whether it be as is reported. The quality of the ground would alſo be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether it be hard, or ſoft; plaine, or hilly; dry, or miry; and ſuch like, that after the batterie once begunne, we be not driuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue our pieces.</p>
               <p>This being reported to the General, he is to cauſe the great ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be drawen toward the place; ſo that about the ſhutting of the euening the ſame may be within moſquet ſhot, yet couered from the Towneſmens viewe, if it may be. With the ſame are two ſtrong ſquadrons of ſhot to march, ſeconded with halberds, and targets, and ſupplied with ſome horſemen. The reſt of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> army diuided into foure partes, are to take their lodgings in foure partes rounde about the Towne. Somewhat farre from the walles, vnleſſe they may couer themſelues with ſome hill, from their ſhotte, or that there be Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes about the Towne. That night euery part is to fortifie their
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18564:128"/>lodgings with trenches, paliſſadaes, barriquades, or ſuch meanes as they haue.</p>
               <p>When the day is gone, let all the ſouldiers that may bee ſpared, and for default of them, let pioners carry baſkets and earth to the place choſen to plant the artillery in, that may not be aboue ſixtie, or ſeuentie paſes from the wall. There diuiding their baſkets into ſo many partes as the maſter of the Ordonance purpoſeth to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide his piecies into: let them beginne to fill their baſkets ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in order as faſt as they can. That they bee not moleſted in their worke, the ſquadrons of ſhotte ſliding along by their ſides, and ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt ſuch as ſhewe themſelues from the walles, are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide: againſt ſallyes the targetters, and halberdes, are to defende them. When the baſkettes are filled: then they may range their pieces behinde them. But if the baſkets bee not defence ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, as ſeldome they are againſt great ſhotte: then vnder couer of the baſkets they are to beginne a trenche, caſting the earth inwarde towarde the pieces to ſerue for a banke. The ſame trench would bee made along the curteine of the wall, the endes of the banke bending inwarde, that there the artillery may bee placed, that ſhooteth on ſlope to the curteine, and direct againſt the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>workes, or flankers.</p>
               <p>For defence of the artillery, and thoſe that are placed there to garde it on both ſides, reaſon requireth, that the banke bee made with diuers corners, and that the whole compaſſe of grounde where the artillerie ſtandeth, bee intrenched: but ſo, that there bee iſſues left for thoſe within to goe within the tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and without them. Vpon the banke, there woulde a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parapet bee made all alongſt where the canon is ranged: fifteene or ſixteene foote in newe earth is little ynough: in that the holes for the canons are to be left. In other places if the parapet bee three or foure foote thicke, it is ſufficient. All along this banke, and along the trenche, are moſquetiers, and other ſhotte to bee ranged. The broader the trenche is, the better it will ſerue to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our men.</p>
               <p>To effect this ſpeedily, many handes are to bee employed. If there be conuenient ſpeede vſed, the ordonance woulde bee ready to ſpeake the next morning. But for that it is not poſſible, that men ſhoulde worke all the night, neither conueniently watche all
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18564:129"/>night: therefore both ſhotte, and targetters, and ſuch as worke the firſt part of the night, would be relieued at midnight, and others ſent in their places both to worke, and to watch.</p>
               <p>The artillerie is to be ranged in three places. Two fourth partes woulde bee placed direct before the cortine of the wall; of the other two partes, one woulde be ranged ſome pretie diſtance off, with the noſes of the pieces pointed towarde the flankers, if any be of the one hand, the other toward the bulwarks, or flankers on the other hand. Yet ſometimes they may hit ſlope wiſe in the cortine of the wall, and thoſe that are pointed againſt the cortine nay be diſcharged againſt the ſhoulders of the flankers.</p>
               <p>If with thy pieces thou canſt not ſee the foote of the wall, then before thou beginneſt the batterie, thou muſt cauſe the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe, or grounde betwixt thee and the wall to bee opened, and the earth caſt into the ditche of the Towne. That is to be done both before the cortine, and before the flankers. If thou doeſt not hitte within two foote of the bottome of the wall, thou doeſt but waſte time, and powder. That the canon may bee mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with more eaſe: if the ſoyle bee ſoft, thou art to make a ſole of plankes, ſomewhat encliuing toward the wall, for the ſame to runne vpon.</p>
               <p>This being done, which is principall, wee are to dreſſe a mount, or caualier, as they call it, ſome hundred paces from the wall, or neerer, directly looking along the wall where the breach is to bee made, there placing foure or fiue pieces of artillerie, wee may beate thoſe that preſent them ſelues to the breache to defend it, or repaire it. By the ſame we may diſcouer thoſe that are vpon the bulwarkes, or goe in the ſtreetes, or within worke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the breache. And therefore where the grounde afoordeth vs commoditie we may not forget to rayſe ſuch a mount, and make it formall for height, breadth, and length, with his ſtayres, parapets, and places for the <hi>corps de garde,</hi> that defendeth it.</p>
               <p>So ſoone as the artillery is placed, and fitted, ſo ſoone the ſame ought to beginne to ſpeake, and that without intermiſſion day, or night, vntill the breach bee made reaſonable, and the defences and flankers bee broken. The continuance of the batterie, and the artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie that beateth in flanke together, with the moſquetiers being placed where they may diſcouer the breach, doeth hinder not onely
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18564:129"/>the repayring of the breach, but alſo the retrenchement behinde. If thy batterie once ceaſe, thy labour and charge increaſeth. Nothing hurt <hi>Monluc</hi> more in the ſiege of <hi>Nyort,</hi> nor <hi>la Chatre</hi> in the ſiege of <hi>Sancerre,</hi> then the diſcontinuance of the batterie which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by reaſon of want of powder. <hi>Sauſar</hi> remouing his batterie at <hi>Vezelay,</hi> confirmed the Towneſmen to holde out, whoſe heartes before fainted. Nothing did more helpe them of <hi>Rochel</hi> in the laſt ſiege, then the frequent intermiſſion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> batterie. By which meanes they made defences ſtronger, then the walles were before.</p>
               <p>The more artillerie is employed, the more ſpeedy and forcible, and leſſe chargeable will the battery be. The <hi>Turke</hi> in the battery of <hi>Vienna,</hi> employed aboue threeſcore canons, culuerins, and other pieces. At <hi>Rochel</hi> the king had fourtie, and the prince of <hi>Parma</hi> litle leſſe in the ſiege of <hi>Scluſe.</hi> He that employeth leſſe then twenty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and other pieces, cannot looke for any good effect. That ſome hoped with foure ſmall pieces to batter the walles of <hi>Coronna,</hi> was without reaſon. Yet I will not deny, that in theſe late troubles of <hi>France,</hi> the Proteſtants with three or foure pieces tooke diuers Townes. For where the walles are bad, and within them no defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; it is not hard to take Townes either with a fewe pieces, or without pieces. But where there are men within, and walles ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, it is better to make no battery, then a battery not ſufficient.</p>
               <p>The great artillery being placed: the canoniers are to place their pouder in ſafe places, and to make their bollets, rammers, waddes, charges, matches, and al theſe inſtruments fit, and ready before they begin their worke. What is the leuell, randon, charge, and effect of euery piece, euery canonier either knoweth, or ought to knowe. And therefore I neede not ſpend time about the declaring thereof.</p>
               <p>While the canon is in placing, and the batterie in making, al thoſe ſouldiers that are not employed about that worke, are to fortifie their quarters with bankes, trenches, and barriquades, and to barre and trenche the wayes, and to keepe good garde, or watche, that none en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſally out: that if not with aſſault, yet for feare of want, the Towne may be forced to come to reaſon.</p>
               <p>That againſt the breach bee made, all things may proceede or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, ladders, mantellets, and targets, and all things requiſite for the aſſault are to be made ready; and to bee deliuered to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, that are to vſe them.</p>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:18564:130"/>
               <p>If there be any time remayning, the ſame is to be employed in making of trenches, and parapets, along the enemies counterſcarpe, likewiſe in ſtopping all the auenues, and wayes, whereby any may come to the ſuccour of the Towne.</p>
               <p>The horſemen and footemen, that may be ſpared from the campe, are to range the countrey, to diſcouer, to repreſſe the enemie, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey victuals to the campe. All which may be done eaſely, if there be no time loſt, nor any diſorder in proceeding.</p>
               <p>If the ground be fit to be wrought; from the trenche behinde the counterſcarpe, it is no hard matter to carry a mine into the Towne, or vnder the walles. The earth, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth out of the mine, being caſt into the ditch, or vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> banke, ſhall ſeeme to come out of the trench, eſpecially where there is continuall working. In making of mines, obſerue theſe rules: <hi>firſt worke not, if the ground be full of ſprings, or rockes. The</hi>

                  <hi>Macedonians going about to vndermine Lamia, were fruſtrated of their purpoſe, encountring with rockes. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beginning to digge, make the mine crooked, that the force of the powder be not broken hauing vent backward. Thirdly ſee that the diſtance from the entrance to the wall be well meaſured, leaſt the powder be placed either ſhort of the wall, or beyond it. Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the foundation of the wall, the miners are firſt to make a broade place along the foundation of it, and to vnderproppe the earth well, that it fall not: ſecondly they are to place their barrels of powder, with their heads knocked of, and bored through with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers holes, and to ſtrawe powder vpon the bordes where the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels ſtand. Thirdly they are to conuey a match well boyled in gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder in a pipe of wood, or betweene boordes, and therein alſo to make a traine of gunpowder from the place where fire is to be giuen to the barrels: their next care is to ſee the mine well ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and rammed, that the fire breake not out backward. Laſtly, when men ſtand ready to goe to the aſſault, yet without danger of the mine, and when the defendants approche the breach, the fire is to be giuen.</hi> Any of theſe points neglected, doeth fruſtrate or hinder the effectes of the mine. At <hi>Rochel</hi> the place where the powder was placed being too narrow, and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> entrance not wel ſtopped, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mine did no great effect. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame ſiege the ſouldiers not being retired, when fire was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, many men loſt their liues by their owne mine. At <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronna</hi> the mine being direct, &amp; not well ſtopped, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of it brake out backward.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:18564:130"/>
               <p>Before the aſſault be giuen, the breach is to be viewed, whether it be reaſonable; likewiſe ſome men of iudgement are to conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the flankers be ruinated ſufficiently. Theſe things appearing, and the ditch made paſſable; the aſſailantes are to march to the breach in this ſorte: firſt certaine targetters, well armed, and with them the enſignes: after them halberdes, and pikes. On the flankes of the targetters, and ſomewhat before them all along the counterſcarpe are ſhot to be placed, to beate them that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the defence of the breach and wall. Theſe are to be ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with other targetters, halberdes, and pikes; with ſhot like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on their flankes. At the ſame time, if there be other breaches in the bulworkes ſome are to march to them alſo ranged in like ſorte. The diſtances of men marching to the breach are ſmall, for they are to march ſo thicke, as they can one by an other, being firſt to enter, &amp; then to fight. The thinner they go, the more open they are to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies force. In theſe late warres of <hi>France</hi> commonly ſhot hath beene placed in the firſt rankes of thoſe that went to the aſſault, and therefore no maruell, if they neuer preuayled, where there was anie reſiſtance. But they could not do otherwiſe hauing ſo few armed men. At that inſtant when the aſſault is to be giuen at the breach, other companies are to be appointed to ſcale in all places of eaſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe. The ſame wil trouble the enemy much, and diuert his forces. In ſcaling this rule is to be obſerued, that while the targettiers goe to the walles, the ſhot beate them that ſtand vpon the walles.</p>
               <p>That there may be ſupply where neede is, the whole army at the time of the aſſault is to be brought into armes, and euerie man to haue his charge aſſigned. Some to defend the lodgings, againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſodaine ſtirres: ſome to diſcouer: others to ſtand in their places appointed, eyther to purſue the victorie, or to fauour the retraite of their fellowes, or to go where they ſhalbe appointed. The more force is employed, the weaker will be the enemies reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that purpoſe to preuaile by aſſault, are to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider further both time, &amp; place, &amp; other circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtances.

What is now the common proceeding in ſieges, batteries, and aſſaults, ſhall now appeare by the examples following.</p>
               <p>The Proteſtants going about to beſiege and win <hi>Poitiers, 1569.</hi> firſt made their approches, &amp; quartered their ſouldiers in the ſuburbs which they took at their firſt arriual, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt part. Next they made their trenches, mounts, &amp; gabions for to accommodate their great ordonance. Part was placed to batter the walles, &amp; part to beate the enemy in flanke behind the cortine. Certaine ſmall peeces they le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled againſt the parapet and certaine defenſes made by the enemie vpon the walles. Of theſe peeces ſome were placed in houſes neere the walles, others were ranged on the plaine behinde gabions, or baſkets of earth, which they filled there in the night. The breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>20</hi> paſes wide, and very plaine, the <hi>Admirall</hi> diſpoſed his men to go to the aſſault in this order: firſt <hi>700.</hi> ſhot marched, after them <hi>300.</hi> gentlemen marched with targets on their armes: after them followed halberds, &amp; pikes: the reſt of the army was ready in armes to ſuccor where neede ſhould be. But their errors were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that theſe good orders auailed litle: firſt they ſpent time about <hi>Luſignen,</hi> and other ſmall matters, and made not their approch, ſo ſoone as they might. In which meane time, the D. of <hi>Guiſe</hi> entred with his troupes, fortified diuers weake places, and prouided diuers thinges neceſſary: ſecondly, their auantgard going before the towne without direction, did nothing, but giue the enemy warning, &amp; ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned: thirdly, they neither trenched, nor barred the wayes, nor kept ſuch ward, or gard, but that both ſuccors entred guided by <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noux,</hi> and diuers times the enemy ſallied both on horſebacke, and on foote: fourthly, they did not take the ſuburbs, nor bridge of <hi>Rochere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> but ſuffered the enemy to poſſeſſe it: yet by reaſon that it flanked
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:18564:133"/>the breach, &amp; ſtopped the water, was it moſt neceſſary to be taken. For the water being there ſtopped regorged vpward, &amp; the enemy being there lodged had a ful marke at thoſe that went along to the breach: fiftly they made their breach beyond the riuer, which by reaſon of the depth of it made them, to their great preiudice, differ the aſſalt al other things being ready, and broke their arrayes as they went ouer the bridge. They might haue done better to haue paſſed their troupes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp; had them on the other ſide before they went to the breach: fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they conſidered not that the ground behinde the breach being hie was not to be mounted, albeit there had beene no wall. And therefore a place euil choſen to make breach in. For albeit they wan the breach yet could they not go forward vp the hill: laſtly, they did neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the enemies forces by eſcalades, nor went to the aſſault with all their forces. Of the ſimple prouiſion of victuals, and bad gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in matters of iuſtice, &amp; diſcipline of armes. I wil ſay nothing, becauſe ſuch diſorders are inſeparable companions of ciuil warres. Yet was there not much better proceeding in the Kings campe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging <hi>Rochell, <hi>Anno</hi> 1573.</hi> which was in this ſort.</p>
               <p>The king before he ſent his forces before the towne, cauſed two enginers to goe thither about other matters, but their purpoſe was to ſound the hauen, &amp; harbor, and to marke the walles, &amp; places of the towne, &amp; to draw a plot of it. Not lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g after he ſent <hi>Biron</hi> thither with ſome forces, which he lodged in villages round about <hi>Rochel.</hi> Who firſt fortified his lodgings with tre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ches, terraſſes, &amp; barriquades: nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to the towne he built certain ſorts at diuers corners of it. His ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery being about <hi>40.</hi> peeces he ranged in <hi>3.</hi> places croſſing one an other. A fourth rank he planted vpon a mount to beate the cortine in flanke. For the gard of the peeces, and canoniers he cauſed not onely gabions of earth, but alſo deepe trenches, and good bankes to be made, with two pieces brought into the ditches he beat the caſemates. To depriue the townſmen of freſh water he cauſed the condu it pipes to be cut. <hi>Monſieur</hi> with his ſhips that ankored in the harbor went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to depriue them of the commodity of the ſea. Hauing with batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and mines made a breach: the kings lieutenant cauſed diuers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults to be made, in the order vſed commonly. Beſide that which is common, he made diuers mantellets to couer his men, and for their eaſier approch, framed a bridge of wood, which from the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe reached to the bulworke neere the breach, But all this in vaine.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:18564:133"/>For neither were the towneſmen ſo ſtraited by ſea or land, but that ſome entred and iſſued both the wayes. Yea ſometimes they entred the trenches, and cut diuers men in peeces: the mine was euill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. For moſt of the force broke out backeward vpon the aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants. The aſſault was not generall, nor did the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies march with one conſent at one time: the eſcalade was but at one place, and that weakely performed. What for want of victualles, and good order, and what by reaſon of winter ſeaſon the ſouldiers grew ſicke and weake: and for want of iuſtice many bad examples eſcaped vnpuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: finally things were long delayed, and diſorderly executed.</p>
               <p>The ſiege, battery, and aſſault of <hi>Sancerre <hi>Anno</hi> 1573.</hi> paſſed in this ſort. The enemy making his approches firſt planted his artillery ſome part about <hi>60.</hi> paſes off, and ſome part neerer: <hi>6.</hi> peeces beat them in flanke being placed on a hil halfe a mile off. On the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe he placed diuers ſhot in a trench which he made there. From that trench he entred the ground comming vnder the walles with a mine: Vnder a frame of wood he brought ſome to zappe the point of the <hi>raueline.</hi> When the breach was made almoſt <hi>80.</hi> paſes wide, and the defenſes euery where beaten downe, hee cauſed his men to march to the aſſault in this order: firſt marched the enſigne colonell of <hi>Sarrieu</hi> garded with targetters, and others well armed; behinde them and vpon their flankes marched certaine companies of ſhot: theſe being repulſed the ſecond charge was giuen by the gentlemen of the country thereabout, which were likewiſe ſeconded by diuers troupes of ſhot: the eſcalade at the time of the aſſault was likewiſe attempted: but nothing ſucceeded. The cauſes were diuers. Firſt the ſhot dragging behind left the armed men almoſt naked on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> front, and ſides, to the ſhot of the towneſmen, which they ſhoulde haue kept occupied. Secondly the eſcalade was faintly executed by one poore company, that went naked to the walles. What might haue beene done by diuers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies well armed, if they hoped to preuaile with one alone? Thirdly, thoſe that marched to the breach went thinne, &amp; diſperſed, which was the cauſe that the ſhot ſo marked them, that all returned not to complaine. Fourthly, the breach was repayred by reaſon of the diſcontinuance of the battery, for want of pouder. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, the mine could not worke any effect, by reaſon the traine tooke not fire, as it ſhould haue doone.</p>
               <p>In no place do I heare of more reſolution and expedition then in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:18564:134"/>the ſiege and aſſault of <hi>Chateleraud, <hi>Anno</hi> 1569.</hi> The firſt day that the enemy approched vnder colour of a ſkirmiſh hee cauſed the walles, ditches, and defences of the towne to be viewed. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery arriuing about midnight, he had placed, and gabionned the ſame in the night in two diuers rankes, and ſo fitted it, that by ſeuen of the clocke the next morning the ſame beganne to batter the foote of the wall. Wherein ſuch was the diligence of the canoniers, and force of the peeces, the bullets entercroſſing one another in the breach, that by two of the clocke in the afternoone in the ſame day the breach was <hi>60.</hi> paſes wide, and the ſouldiers readie to march to the aſſault. Wherein if the ſouldiers within had not bene very reſolute, and the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> without very ſlacke in ſeconding the <hi>Italians</hi> that had the point of the aſſault, or if the eſcalade had withall beene preſented at two or three other places: they had percaſe preuailed. At <hi>Xaintes, Scipio the enginer</hi> purpoſing to make a breach diſcharged a peece where he meant not to batter. Which cauſed the towneſmen to ſpend their earth, labour, and prouiſion, where no neede was. Then<note n="a" place="margin">Hiſtoir. de trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bl. de Fr. l. <hi>13.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>changing</hi> the place of his peeces brought them hard to the ditch of the towne, where he made a breach threeſcore paſes wide. To hinder the reparation thereof, he had placed foure coluerins, and diuers ſmall peeces vpon a mount to beate them in flanke behind the breach. After that there marched to the aſſault firſt certaine ſhot, then fortie cuyraces of proofe, and laſt of all certaine other ſhot.</p>
               <p>The county of <hi>Lude</hi> did thus dreſſe the preparatiues to the aſſault of <hi>Niort, <hi>Anno</hi>
                  </hi> a thouſand fiue hundred ſixtie and eight. after hee had with his canons placed in two houſes neere the walles, made a breach thirtie paſes wide, and had raiſed two coluerins ſo high, that they might beate the defendants in flanke all along the cortine of the wall: three enſignes marched to the breach, others preſented the eſcalade. Theſe being eaſily repulſed, to the ſecond charge marched firſt one principall commander, and after him twentie targettiers: then certain ſhot: after them folowed the enſigne colonell, and after it diuers other enſignes with a ſtrong garde of halberdes and pikes. The reſt of the army ſtoode ready in ſquadrons. The horſemen were alſo in armes to repreſſe the towneſmen, if they ſhould dare to ſallie. But all this ſerued not. For in the firſt charge there wanted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and reſolution: in the ſecond, execution. For hauing wet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in paſſing a little riuer, moſt ſtayed, the reſt went faintly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:18564:134"/>in ſumme all the brauery which they ſhewed at the firſt, in the end prooued nothing but a brag.</p>
               <p>If the Proteſtants had not proceeded more reſolutely in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and aſſault of <hi>Brouage Anno 1570.</hi> they had not ſo ſoone pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed. <hi>Scipio</hi> by trenches made his approches, and within thirteene paces of the ditch placed his peeces within a certaine defence for the canoniers made of ſacks of wooll, and earth. With the canon he beat the cortine, and baſtion towards <hi>Oleron.</hi> With the artillery, and ſhot of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Carrake which hee cauſed to be brought along the Hauen, and to be placed hard to the Fort or Caſtle of the towne, he ſo beat them that were within, that none could come to the walles or looke out without danger. Which expedition, and reſolution of the aſſaylants did ſo amaze the townſmen, that preſently they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall to compoſition.</p>
               <p>Thus wee ſee howe thoſe that proceede carefully, diligently, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and according to the practice of warre doe ſeldome fayle of their purpoſe, but either by ſiege, ſurpriſe, or aſſault they take the townes, which they beſet. Townes that cannot be taken neither by ſleight, nor force at the firſt; yet by continuance and perſeuerance, may be taken at the laſt by one meanes, or other, eſpecially if they be weakened in one or two ſallyes. <hi>Annibal</hi> by a deuiſe cauſing the <hi>Locrians</hi> to ſally out of their towne, cut betweene them and their ſafety, and by taking them, made the reſt to yeelde. Hee would haue trained out thoſe that garded the Caſtle of <hi>Tarentum,</hi> by laying a bayt for them, but they were too wiſe. <hi>Romulus</hi> by a feined retrayt drawing the <hi>Fidenians</hi> ſome prety diſtance from the towne, cut moſt of them in peeces, and purſuing the reſt entred <hi>Pelle Melle</hi> with them into the towne.</p>
               <p>Many other ſtratagemes may be deuiſed, whereby townes may be forced, or ſurpriſed: but ſeeing the generall reaſons are apparent by this which I haue ſayd, now I will turne my ſpeech to thoſe that aduerſe euents driue to defend them ſelues within townes. For prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of warre doeth teach vs not only to force others, but alſo where the enemy purſueth vs, to defend our ſelues.</p>

They that take on them to defend townes neither well prouided nor fenced, howſoeuer they ſhew therein courage, yet doe they ſhewe no iote of wiſedome in it; for oft times they caſt away themſelues, and hurt their Prince, and countrey both in the loſſe of ſo many men, &amp; in giuing courage to the enemy.

               </p>
               <p>Before that the enemie approcheth, the Gouernour is to cauſe all houſes and villages neere the towne to be ruinated and fired, and all the wood and timber as neere as may be, either to be brought into the towne, or ſpoyled. Lamentable (I confeſſe) it will be to the country, but who would not rather ſpoyle ſuch things, then ſuffer the enemie to vſe them againſt himſelfe?</p>
               <p>In ſtopping of the enemies approches, let him vſe this courſe: firſt if there be any narow wayes which the enemie muſt paſſe, before hee can come before the towne, let them bee well trenched and garded: when the ſame cannot longer be garded for feare leaſt the enemie cut betwixt the <hi>corps de gard</hi> and the towne, let them then retire &amp; make head in the<note n="d" place="margin">The <hi>Italians</hi> call it <hi>Via co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perta.</hi>

                  <hi>couert way</hi> behind the counterſcarpe, not onely for the defence thereof, but alſo for defence of the playne before the towne, eſpeciallie of that place, where the enemie meaneth to range his
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:18564:139"/>pieces for the batterie. For defence whereof likewiſe, both the great ordonance from the bulwarkes, and other ſhot from the walles are to be imploied. In caſe the enemie by his negligence giue occaſion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the euening, or in the night, hee may make a ſallie vpon thoſe that labour about the pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting of the ordonance, &amp; the gabions. If the enemie be ſo ſtrong that hee is able to take away the<note n="a" place="margin">The counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe is the banke that is made all along without the ditch of the fortreſſe.</note> counterſcarpe, then by traines and<note n="b" place="margin">Caſemates are defences of earth within ditches or trenches, where the ſouldiers lie couered, to ſhoote at thoſe that preſent themſelues vnto them.</note> caſemates in the ditch, by ſallies and ſhot from the bulwarkes and wals, he is to defend his ditch ſo long as hee can. And laſt of all being beaten out of the ditch, his laſt hope is in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his wals and bulwarkes, ſuſtaining them with good terraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of earth, and when they are beaten downe, repairing them, and when no longer they can be defended by making retrenchments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them.</p>
               <p>For defence of a breach, this courſe is good, and commonly vſed. Firſt all along where the enemie maketh his batterie, let there bee preſently vpon the firſt ſhot a retrenchment made; the deeper the ditch is, and the higher the banke is rayſed, the better the worke proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth: vpon the banke, or els behind the banke, let ſome pieces be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in counterbatterie. In houſes neere adioyning, and vpon the banke, let the ſmall ſhot be diſpoſed chicke. Againſt the enemies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillerie that beateth in flanke, let there be an high terraſſe of earth rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. On both ſides of the breach in places conuenient, the armed men are to be placed to repell ſuch as eſcape the ſhot. If the place haue bulwarkes or towers that looke along the ditch, from thence the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie is to be galled vpon the flankes as they enter the ditch: if there be none, then mounts or terraſſes are to be rayſed in ſuch places, as moſt commodiouſlie wee may looke into the ditch, and toward the breach. Walles or bankes are to be caſt vp beneath the breach in the ditch. Laſtly, if ſtore of men will permit it, a ſallie of targetters and other armed men is to bee made out of the towne vpon the ſides of thoſe that are vpon the counterſcarpe, or within the ditch: which no doubt will make the enemie make more ſpeed to returne.</p>
               <p>This or the like proceeding, both ancient and later practiſe of warre hath taught vs in the defence of townes beſieged, and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The <hi>Plataeans</hi> beſieged, hauing ſet order for their prouiſion and the gouernement of their people, to repell the enemies force, rayſed their walles higher in that part where the enemie made ſhew to aſſaile them. All along the mount which the enemie built without,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:18564:139"/>they made a new wall within their olde. <hi>When the</hi>

                  </hi> which then was threatened by the Proteſtants to be beſieged, firſt encouraged the people with good words, then together with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principal me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the towne going about to marke the weakeſt places of the walles, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed rampiers and trenches to be made preſently. In that worke hee
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:18564:140"/>cauſed all the inhabitants to labour. Afterward being bet in flanke, he raiſed vp a terraſſe neere the breach, ſpreading ſheetes and clothes before it for to couer the workemen: for grinding of corne he cauſed handmils to be made, and finally ſet good order for the adminiſtring of matters of warre, and iuſtice. But if he had burnt the ſuburbes, and beaten downe the houſes neere the wals, and defended the Rauelin by the gate <hi>Drouaize</hi> more carefully and ſtrongly, hee had done farre better. Theſe things being neglected, the enemie placed his ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance neere to the wall in houſes, from whence he diſcouerd y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> breach, and diuers places of the towne, and hurt diuers. He lodged his men ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commodiouſly in the ſuburbes, and taking that Rauelin, had entred the citie, if he had folowed his good hap, or kept the place.</p>
               <p>The duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> Gouernour of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> entring a litle before the ſiege which the Proteſtants laid before the town, <hi>anno 1569.</hi> ſpent firſt one day in viewing the walles, and appointing fortifications and defences to be made, which was alſo executed with great expedition. He tooke the next day the moſter of all the ſouldiers, and inhabitants able to beare armes, to ſee what ſtrength hee had. Afterward hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed officers, &amp; orders for the ſtorehouſes of victuals. Further he ſet ſome on worke to make pouder, others to burne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> houſes nere the gates. The light horſemen he ſent out to take ſome priſoners, &amp; of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vnderſtand the diſſeins of the enemie, &amp; for auoiding of ſurpriſes, would not ſuffer bell to ring, nor clocke to ſtrike during the ſiege. For defence of the breach he cauſed a retrenchment to be made behind the wall: againſt the pieces that bet his men in flanke, he oppoſed a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe of earth: and directly againſt the breach placed certaine pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in countrebatterie. For ſuſtaining y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſſault, he aſſigned to euerie man his quarter, diſpoſed his ſhot vpon the wals, &amp; in certain houſes neere to beat the enemie approching both in front, &amp; in flanke. Neere the wals he had his armed men readie, his horſemen he ſent about the ſtreetes to keepe men in order, and to ſend thoſe that were there to the breach; onely this was omitted, hee burnt not the ſuburbes, nor ſpoiled the countrey round about, nor prouided cornemils, nor diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the towne of ſuch as were vnfit for ſeruice, nor of aſſes and iades that ſpent the haie ſo faſt, that in the ende there wanted for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his horſe of ſeruice.</p>
               <p>They of <hi>Rochel</hi> againſt the ſiege that folowed <hi>an. 1573.</hi> firſt forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their towne, and then ſet order for their gouernement: withall
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:18564:140"/>they made the beſt prouiſion of victuals and munitions, they could: they ſent to their friendes for ſuccour: they hindered the approches of the enemy by diuers ſallies: for defence of the breach, they made a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchment behinde, and filled the breach vp with ſackes of earth, and other things. For couering thoſe that wrought, they made a thicke ſmoke before the breach. Againſt the breach they ranged diuers pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in contrebatterie. To ſuſteine the aſſalt, they placed the ſhot on the flankes, and walles, placed ſquadrons of armed men both by the breach, and in other places: with traines of powder in the ditche, they ſcorched the enemie that came to the breache. Vpon the formoſt they caſt ſtones, fire, ſcalding water, hot tarre, and pitch: yet might they haue done better, if they had made better prouiſion of thinges neceſſarie: next, if they had not made ſo many vaine and weake ſallies. If in one ſallie thoſe that went out firſt, had bene well ſeconded, they had ſurely rayſed the ſiege: while they ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the houſes, and villages, and woods neere the Towne, they miniſtred many commodities to the enemie, without which hee coulde not as hee did, haue continued his ſiege the whole winter long.</p>
               <p>In the ſiege of <hi>S. Iean d'Angeli, anno 1569,</hi> capteine <hi>Piles</hi> wan to himſelfe great commendation. The towne was not ſtrong, yet did he holde it long. The enemy wanne no ground vpon him, but it coſt him deare. Vpon his firſt approch he made ſo couragious a ſally, that he made the enemy to giue ground. In the place of the breach, he made a wall in the ditch before it, and a retrenchment within be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde it, and caſting the earth inward, raiſed a banke vpon it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon he placed diuers pipes of earth, for defence of his ſouldiers. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſide of the breach, he raiſed vp a platforme of earth, with a parapet, for ſauing his men. By this meanes he ſuſteined diuers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and at diuers ſallies cut diuers of the enemies in peeces, and cloyed and diſmounted diuers Canons. If his prouiſion of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and munitions, and the ſtrength of men had bene greater, he had no doubt kept the Towne ſtill: but wanting all thinges, and his platforme being newe, and but fifteene foote thicke, and pierced by euery Canon ſhotte, and not able long to ſtand; force it was for him to accept of an honourable compoſition offered him by the king.</p>
               <p>And although the Towne of <hi>Sancerre</hi> was yeelded in the ende to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:18564:141"/>the enemy, yet doe the defendants deſerue to be remembred for their reſolute defenſe, and reaſonable good gouerment. When they heard that the enemy determined to beſiege them, they choſe a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour, and ioyned with him a Counſell of Capteines, and the moſt apparent Citizens. Next, they moſtred their people, enrolled them in bands, and aſſigned to euery man his charge and quarter, &amp; appointed orders ſuch as the time required. For defence of the breach, they made a retrenchment, and defended the ſame with gabions on the front, and ſides, where they placed their ſhotte, to ſerue at the time of the aſſault. To ſuſteine the aſſault, they ranged their ſhot there, and on the wals, and in a certein gallery, and other houſes neere the breach. Vpon the ſides of the breach, and in other places conuenient, they placed their halberds, pikes, and armed men: but wanting victuals, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, and men requiſite for defence of ſuch a place, they were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to accept of a harde compoſition. Whereunto, if they had not ſpared their money in the beginning, or had ſent out ſuch as for age, and impotencie were not fit for ſeruice, they could not haue bene ſo eaſily forced.</p>
               <p>The aſſault of <hi>Chateleraud, anno 1569,</hi> as it was forcible, ſo was it valiantly ſuſteined by diuers braue men directed by <hi>Scipio</hi> the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giner. The breach being <hi>80</hi> paces wide, was ſo great, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies comming ſo ſpeedy, that they could not make any retrenchment behinde it. Therefore leauing that courſe, vpon each ſide of the breach they made gabions and barriquadaes, behinde which they placed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers valiant men, armed with cuyraces, and targets. The front be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the breach, was ſufficiently fenced with houſes. In the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes of the houſes, and in certeine holes made for the purpoſe, they placed their beſt ſhot, other ſhot they placed vpon the walles behinde the parapet, and in a certeine gallery that ouerlooked the breach. When the <hi>Italians</hi> that had the point, came to the aſſault, and had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the breach; they that were couered vnder the gabions, ſallied vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the firſt, the ſhot from the houſes, gallery, and walles, diſpatched a number of the reſt.</p>
               <p>In defence of townes beſieged by the enemy, no time is to be loſt, no coſt, nor labour to be ſpared. By negligence, delaies, ſparing, and want of ſkill of the Gouernors, many townes are loſt. It grieueth me to thinke howe <hi>Caleis, Bullein, Rochel,</hi> and other Townes, which ſometime this nation poſſeſſed in <hi>France,</hi> were loſt by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:18564:141"/>and miſgouernment. But that it is the lot of all townes that that are committed to ſuch weake perſons, as beſide the name haue nothing of nobility. <hi>Alcida</hi>

               <p>The ſiege is raiſed ſometime through want, or miſſgouernment in the campe, when for want of victuals, or other diſorder the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his owne accord departeth. Sometime through ſickenes, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time through the diſtemper of the weather, ſometime through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention of ſouldiers; ſometime he remooueth to ſuccour his owne people, ſtraited in ſome other place: ſometime by ſallies of the townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or ſuccour of their friendes, he is driuen away. All thoſe wants therfore that may mooue him to depart, are to be increaſed, and all thoſe meanes that may haſten his departure, to be vſed. He is to be ſtreited for victuals by our friendes without. Some Towne which he fauoreth is to be beſieged, his waters are to be corrupted, the place where he lyeth, if it may be, is to be drowned.

               <p>Reſteth nowe for the finiſhing of this diſcourſe, concerning the defence of places, that I ſhewe howe any place may with labour be fortified, and what rules are to be obſerued in the making of bulworkes, walles, ditches, bankes, and all ſortes of fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not in ſuch curious ſorte, as doe the <hi>Italians,</hi> which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be well vnderſtoode of ſouldiers vnacquainted with Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricall termes, nor practiſed in time of warres, by reaſon of the time required in the rayſing of them: which notwithſtanding may ſerue them in tyme of neceſſitie, as well as the artificiall worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:18564:142"/>of <hi>Italians</hi> that coſteth millions, and alwayes helpeth not. Yet would I not haue thinges made either rudely without propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor haſtily without perfection, nor niggardly without thinges conuenient.</p>
               <p>In ancient time, before the vſe of gunnes was found out, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of walled townes was, leſt they might be taken with ſcaling, or their walles ruinated with ſhaking or zapping, their defence againſt ſcaling, was the height of the walles; againſt ſhaking, the mixture of wood, and ſtone, and thickneſſe. <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſheweth that the <hi>Gaules</hi> in his time faſhioned their walles checker wiſe, filling a frame of timber with ſquare ſtones. ſo that for euery piece of timbers head there was a ſquare ſtone of that bigneſſe layed in the wall. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the height of their walles, they made high towers vpon them, in diſtance foureſcore, or an hundred paces one from another. Their defence was ſtones, pieces of timber, iauelines, dartes, arrowes, and whatſoeuer coulde hurt the enemy throwen from the wall. Theſe thinges for that their force was increaſed by the height of the walles, therefore did they builde them high, as alſo to hinder the eſcaladaes of the enemy. Now for that great ordonance doth hurt more in flanke then forward, and ſhaketh any wall though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo thicke, and thoſe moſt eaſily that are higheſt; therefore the vſe is to builde walles lowe, that they may the better be ſuſteined by the terraſſe behinde, and more hardly diſcouered by reaſon of the counterſcarpe. for defence whereof, there are bulwarkes builded out from the wall into the ditch, that the great ordonance being there placed, may not onely ſhoote forward into the field, but in flanke along the ditch, and the wall.</p>
               <p>Thoſe townes therefore, and caſtles, I account to be well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, that firſt are ſtrongly walled, or banked round, with bulwarkes in conuenient diſtances to flanke the walles, or banke; ſecondly, that behinde the walles haue a good rampare or terraſſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them a deepe and broad ditch: and laſt of all a ſufficient coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſcarpe, with his couert way, with all the partes, and meaſures of the wall, terraſſe, bulwarkes, ditch, and counterſcarpe proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Where there is either part or proportion wanting, there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſo much of the perfection, and ſtrength, that is in ſuch workes required. Whoſoeuer therefore purpoſeth to fortifie a place, muſt haue reſpect firſt to the wall, and rampare, or to the banke, next
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:18564:143"/>to the bulwarkes, thirdly, to the ditch, and laſtly, to the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarpe.</p>
               <p>The partes of the wall are theſe, firſt the foundation, then the wall to the cordon, and laſtly, that aboue the cordon. Cordon I call that rowe of ſtones that diuideth that part of the wall that is loweſt, and couered with the counter ſcarpe from the enemies ſhot, and leaneth much inward to the towne, from that which is for the moſt part open, and higher then the counterſcarpe, and leaneth leſſe inward then the lower part of the wall.</p>
               <p>The whole height of the wall from the ditch to the top, is more or leſſe according to the iudgement of the Enginer, and meanes, and time hee hath to builde it in. Prouided that it be not eaſily reached with ladders. it is ſufficient if it be betwixt fiue and fortie or fortie foot high. of which albeit the parapet be beaten downe, yet few ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ladders will reach ſo high.</p>
               <p>The foundation of the wall would be made firme, and euen, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a little inward. if the ſoile be ſoft and moiſt, it muſt be holpen with piles of wood driuen downe thicke into the ground, and ſtones rammed faſt betweene them. if the ſoile be rocky, then muſt the ſame be made plain, or at leaſt with degrees be aten out with the picke, and made leuell, that the ſtones may lie orderly, ſaue that toward the towne as the reſt of the foundation it ought to be a little lower.</p>
               <p>The foundation of the<note n="a" place="margin">The cortine of the wall is that diſtance or part of the wall that is betwixt bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, turret &amp; turret, for that it is ſpred for the couering of the towne.</note> cortine of the wall being laid, the firſt ſtone of the wall would be layd one foot from the boord of the foundation, if no more. That part of the foundation that is without the wall the <hi>Italians</hi> call <hi>relaſciato,</hi> which is nothing els in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> then that which is left of the foundation.</p>
               <p>The wall the <hi>Italians</hi> would haue made ſo thicke at the foot, that in the middeſt there may be left a ſpace for a man to goe along in round about the walles. this they call <hi>contramina.</hi> But it is coſt to no purpoſe: for to vent a mine, the countermine is to be made as lowe as the foundation of the wall and lower, and rather in the ditch, if it be drie, then in the wall. The wall would be made ſo thicke at the foundation, that albeit in euery fiue foot of height it leane inward, and looſe one foot of breadth or thickeneſſe, yet at the cordon it may be twelue or fifteene foot thicke. From the cordon vpward the wall is to leane inward, and to looſe of his thickeneſſe in euery fiue one halfe foot.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:18564:143"/>
               <p>The rampar or terraſſe behinde the walles would be raiſed vntill you come within foure or fiue foot of the toppe of the wall. This vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permoſt part for that it gardeth the ſouldiers that are behinde it, when they turne their breaſts to ſhoot, or ſtrike the enemy is called <hi>parapet.</hi> If the ſame be not raiſed ſo high, but that the wall is ſeuen or eight foot higher, as it is at <hi>Luca</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> &amp; in the bourg at <hi>Rome,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners places, which I haue ſeene: then muſt there be made a bancke or way vpon the inſide of the wall foure foot within the toppe of it, and degrees to mount from the rampar vnto it, in diuers places.</p>
               <p>The rampar cannot be too broad, but nine or ten paſes it would be, if it be made ſufficient. if it be leſſe, hardly can you fit the cannon or coluerin vpon it. The height is proportionable to the wall, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue ſhewed. Toward the towne the rampar would be made ſomewhat ſtope and pendant, that the ſouldiers may go vp and downe the ſame in all places, when need requires; in the ſame like wiſe are ſtaires to be made in diuers places, that thoſe that haue occaſion may go vp vnto it with carriages. The ſide of it would be ſet with trees, for thereby the earth will be holden vp more firme, and the ſame may in time ſerue to many good vſes.</p>
               <p>Within euery two hundred paſes or thereabout, there would be a bulwarke erected, the outward walles made in the ſame ſort, that the walles of the cortine are made, but more thicke and high by two or three foot. Theſe are made for gard both of the great ordonance that beat along the ditch and cortine, and that which is pointed into the fieldes. Theſe are ſometime made with two ſtages, or places for the ordonance, the one aboue, the other beneath; ſometime with one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly place, ſometimes all ſolide without any places at all, as in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> for the moſt part. the which are rather to be called terraſſes then bulwarkes, for that they onely ſerue to place great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donance vpon them to flanke the walles or bankes ſomewhat, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to ſcoure the plaines without.</p>
               <p>The forme of them commeth nereſt to fiue ſquare, the baſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is the rampar behinde that part of the walles that goeth to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bulwarke, and is behinde it. If thou wouldeſt make a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke at any corner of a wall, meaſure out from the point thereof fortie paſes, and draw a line of that length equally diſtant from the cortine of the wall on either hand. From the cortine take of ech hand <hi>25</hi> paſes, and from that point that is <hi>25</hi> paſes from the corner,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:18564:144"/>
                  <hi>draw a line</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Ad aequales an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulos, or ad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculum.</note>
                  <hi>direct from the wall long two &amp; twenty paſes.</hi> From this line of two and twentie paſes take tenne to ſerue for the ditch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the towne wall and the<note n="b" place="margin">The <hi>Italians call it <hi>Orecchion</hi>
                     </hi> or <hi>Spalla del Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardio.</hi>
                  </note> ſhoulder of the bulwarke. the reſt ſerueth to make the ſhoulder it ſelfe. From this point draw a line to to that point that is fortie paſes from the corner of the wall. and ſo thou haſt the delineation of the one part or face of the bulwarke. doe the like on the other hand, and ſo thou haſt thy bulwarke delineated in good proportion. which not being obſerued in the bulwarkes of <hi>Berwike,</hi> maketh them ſhew crooked and deformed: but that is one of their leaſt faults.</p>
               <p>From the line that is fiue and twentie paſes long take twelue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on either ſide toward the point of the corner of the wall, and thence drawing a direct line directly to the ſhoulder of the bulwarke, vpon that line worke a wall all of maſſiue ſtone, and when thou art come tenne or twelue foot high, make there foure loope holes for the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and within the wall a ſole for the ordonance to runne on, well planed, but ſomewhat inclining to the ditch. The loope holes would be a yard broad, and foure foot high. The firſt loope hole that is nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to the cortine, would be made foure foot diſtant from the ſaid cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, that the connon placed there may ſerue to ſcoure the front of the next bulwarke that is vnto it, and the ditch and counterſcarpe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, being more then two hundred paſes off. The other three loope holes would be made in equall diſtance one from another, and ſo farre aſunder, that both the cannon may recoile without touching any thing, and that in the middeſt there may be made a pillar to beare the floure of the place aboue. The vſe of the three pieces placed in theſe three loope holes, is to defend the cortine of the wall, and the ditch. and therefore the ſole where they runne, is to be made ſo high, that with their noſes they may looke ſomewhat downward into the ditch. In the middeſt of the lower place thou art to make a pillar all of maſſiue ſtone, neither ſo bigge that it hinder the recoiling of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, nor ſo little, but that it may beare the vault, and the cannon there placed aboue. In this vpper place thou art likewiſe to make foure loope holes, as in the place beneath: but if the ſame be vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, a good parapet well crenelled will ſerue for the loope holes. Within the bulwarke alſo there would be a place made for the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping drie of the munition, and inſtruments occupied about the ordo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and alſo for keeping of armes for the ſouldiers. The entrance
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:18564:144"/>into this place and vnto the places of the canon would be from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And that the ſouldiers or Canoniers may ſally or goe out into the ditch there would be made a doore in the cortine of the wall neere to the firſt loope hoole. The like places, loope holes, and doore is to be made on the other hand of the bulwarke.</p>
               <p>All the bulwarke ſaue the places for the artillery, and munition, and except, if you wil, the countermine going to the point of the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warke, would be filled with earth beaten ſmall, and wel rammed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The wall of the bulwarke would bee made like the wall of the towne vnleſſe it pleaſe them that beſtowe the charge to haue it thicker: and either may it be made with cordon, or without. The <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapet</hi> of the bulwarke would be more firme, then that of the wall. And in diuers places would there bee made ſoles for the canon to runne vpon aboue the bulwarke. The ſhoulder of the bulwarke being made for defence of the canon placed in the loope holes woulde bee made ſtrong. And likewiſe would the point of the bulwarke be for that the enemy vſeth there to make entrance with his mattocke, or zappe.</p>
               <p>I know fewe bulwarkes are ſo large, or halfe ſo large as this that I haue deſcribed, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſer they are the more they want of ſtrength and of perfection; and deſerue in deede to be called rather <hi>terraſſes,</hi> then otherwiſe. Thoſe therefore that doe meane to make them ſtrong, let them make them alſo large, and if they make not their <hi>terraſſes</hi> with ſuch places as I haue deſcribed, yet let them leaue ſome places, where to beſtow the canon for defence of the ditch and cortine.</p>
               <p>Where the wall is round, or crooked, or ſo long that one bulwarke cannot ſuccour another, or that the ſame is ſo vneauen, that the cortine cannot be made proportionable for diſtance: there the remedy is in the midſt of the cortine to make platformes, and <hi>caualiers,</hi> or mounts. The platforme is made of the ſame matter, and almoſt in the ſame forme that the bulwarke hath; likewiſe it commeth out from the wall as doeth the bulwarke. But the difference is, that it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the midſt of the plaine cortine, and is nothing ſo large as the bulwarke, nor hath thoſe places, and loope hooles that the bulwarke hath, and ſerueth onely to place the ordonance vpon it aboue.</p>
               <p>Sometimes that which platformes doe being ioyned to the wall, that doe <hi>rauelins,</hi> or <hi>terraſſes</hi> deuided from the wall, which forme <hi>la Nouè</hi> commendeth, and I do not miſtike: For both the charge and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is leſſe, and well they may ſerue to ſtrengthen ſome weake
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:18564:145"/>place, that otherwiſe is not fortified. And the ſame being beaten, yet the wall remaineth ſafe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Theſe <hi>Caua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> are terraſſes of earth built without, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walles. So called becauſe they looke ouer the walles.</note>
                  <hi>Caualiers</hi> or mountes are made within the walles ſome two or three paces, &amp; are employed to the ſame purpoſe that platformes are. From them they differ, that the platformes are rayſed in the ditche, and ioyne to the wall, where as mounts are made within. They are to be made higher then the walles to looke into the ditch to ſcoure the plaine or vppermoſt ſuperficies of the bulwarkes on either hand, and to diſcouer the plaine. The forme is foure ſquare, yet oft times broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then long. The ſtuffe is earth, and fagots for the moſt part, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vp with bordes and pieces of timber. The length is more or leſſe according to the neceſſitie of the place, and time that is giuen vs to make it in. Some make them <hi>180</hi> foote broade, and long <hi>150</hi> the <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapet</hi> would be <hi>20</hi> foote thicke on front and on the ſides. The ſtaires that are made to aſcend the <hi>caualier,</hi> are made behinde.</p>
               <p>The place being thus walled round with walles direct, and well flanked with bulwarkes at euery corner, either in conuenient diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or els ſuccorde with platformes or mounts in the midſt of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, cannot eaſily beforced, if it be wel defended.</p>
               <p>Whether it be better to haue fiue, or ſixe, or more bulwarkes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout one towne, or fortereſſe it is hard to determine: for if the cortine be made right, and of a reaſonable length, and the bulwarkes bee ſo placed that one may entreſuccour another, how many corners ſoeuer the fortereſſe is, the ſame is good. Onely fortereſſes of foure corners and bulwarks, and much more thoſe of three, becauſe the bulwarkes cannot one defend another vnleſſe they be made very ſharpe &amp; weake, of men of experience haue bene found defectiue. The fortereſſe of <hi>Porto Hercole</hi> in the territorie of <hi>Siena</hi> is of three corners, but it was ſo built either by reaſon of the ground that would admit no other forme, or for that the inſufficiencie of thoſe ſmal bulwarkes with three corners was not knowne when that was made.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that either haue not time or meanes to make walles, and bulwarkes of ſtone, if they will obſerue the ſame meaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, may make the ſame very wel and ſtrongly of earth, clay and ſmall rubble mingled together, and either made in morter ſtiffened with ſtraw, or els borne vp with ſmall and ſtraight ſticks layd thinne in the workes. In <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and other places of the low Countrie, there are diuers good fortifications made onely of turffes
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:18564:145"/>of earth well layde and faſtened together on the out ſides, and within ſtuffed with earth and rubble. Onely the places for the canon which are made in bulwarkes of ſtone, in theſe kindes of fortifications are wanting, and the pointes of the bulwarkes made very weake and ſubiect to zapping. Yet with timber I would not doubt to make one ſufficient place on either ſide of the bulwarke to range the canon in to beate low along the ditch and cortine; and with fagots alſo to make both the ſhoulder and point of the bulwarke as ſtiffe, as if were made with ſtone.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that fortifie their places only with turffes, or earth of which both the walles and bulwarkes are to conſiſt, are thus to proceede in their worke. Firſt the ground is to bee plained ſo broade as they meane to make their banke, or rampar, or bulwarke, and that would I not haue leſſe then <hi>14</hi> paſes at the bottome. Some what lower in the midſt then in the outſides. The ground being plained, a ranke of turffes is to be layde outwarde, euery one a yarde or three quarters long if the earth be tough, and likewiſe a ranke of turffes of a worſer ſort inwarde to the towne. They are to be made thinne to the inſide and thicke to the outſide: vpon the endes of theſe turffes, are other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer turffes to bee layde, and the ſpace within to be filled with ſmall earth well rammed together. Vpon theſe rankes of turffes other rankes of turffes are to be layde and to be faſtened together, and to be filled in the midſt vntill the ſame come to a ſufficient height. The banke is to be made leaning inwarde, the better to holde vp the earth. The earth muſt be digged out of the ditch al along the banke, leaning a yarde or more from the foundation of the banke, which the worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finiſhed, may be plained and faſhioned to the banke, and may ſerue to make the banke ſeeme hie.</p>
               <p>To make a banke of earth and haſell rods, or other bruſh mingled together, this is the courſe. Firſt the earth is to be plained, where the foundation is to be made, then ſmall earth well ſifted and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee layde halfe a foote thicke, and aboue that ſmall rods with their heads layde as eauen as may be: and to the endes of thoſe, other rods are to be layde, and earth ouer them, this is to be done both on the outſide, and inſide, and ſo to be mingled and rammed together vntill the banke come to the full height. The banke is to be made ſlope for the better lying of the earth, and to bee filled with earth digged out of the ditch for eaſe of the labourers.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:18564:146"/>
               <p>If neither turffes of earth, nor ſticks may be had ſufficient, then the outward cruſt on both ſides of the ramper, would be made of morter well mingled with hay and ſtraw, or els if the ground be ſtony, of ſtones layde in morter. The inmoſt part, if it be filled with earth and rubble, and well rammed; wil ſtand when the ſtones ruſe downe, and beare many canon ſhot, if it be of ſufficient thickeneſſe. This maner of fortification requiring no great coſt, and being perfited onely with labour: greatly were it to be wiſhed, that <hi>Plimmouth, Falmouth,</hi> and other Port townes in England were ſo banked, and fortified. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in continuance of time ſuch bankes are beaten flat, yet would they beare off any ſuddeine force.</p>
               <p>When the worke is come to the height, then is the <hi>parapet</hi> to bee made <hi>4</hi> paſes broade, if thy banke will beare it. And to mount vp the rampar, ſtaires would be caſt out in diuers places. The broader the banke is, the better the earth will lye, and the better reſiſtance it will make. But if the ſame be weake in any place, then is the ſame to be defended with mounts from within, and <hi>rauelins</hi> without.</p>
               <p>The meaſures of the bulwarkes of earth with al their parts would be either equal to thoſe that are made of ſtone, or larger, becauſe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the ditch would ſoone be filled with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ruſing downe of the earth.</p>
               <p>In making the walles and bulwarkes, the breadth alſo and faſhion of the ditch is to be caſt: for if they be done both together, the earth that is digged out of the ditch may ſerue to make the rampar. The ditch where it is narroweſt would be <hi>15</hi> paſes broade. If it be made narrower, it may the more eaſily bee filled vp by the enemy, and by the ruines of the bankes and walles. In <hi>France</hi> the ditches made in olde time are either <hi>a dos de l'aſue,</hi> that is, deepe and narrow in the midſt, and riſing on both ſides, as the ditches about <hi>Amiens,</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;</hi> or els <hi>a fond de cuue,</hi> that is, equally deepe in the bottome, and ſteepe vpon the ſides. In both which the foote of the wall is open to the view, and eaſily battred. Neither doe the defenſes made vpon the rampar on which the wal is built, which they cal <hi>fauſſes brayes</hi> helpe the matter. Now the wall being rayſed out of the ditch, the bottome of the ſame would be leuell, but broade and deepe; And in the midſt of it a deepe trench, which in dry ditches ſerueth to diſcouer the enemies Mines, in watry places to conuey away the water. Some for defence of their ditch haue built a wall in the midſt of it, as in the ditches of <hi>Caleis:</hi> but it is to no purpoſe, ſeeing for the lowneſſe of it, either
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:18564:146"/>with the ruines of the wall, or with earth and faggots caſt into the ditches, it is ſoone couered.</p>
               <p>Whether the ditch be drie or full of water, it ſkilleth not greatly. For as both haue their diſcommodities; ſo they haue alſo their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. A fortreſſe enuironed with a deepe water, is leſſe ſubiect to ſudden enterpriſes, except it be in time of hard froſt. The ſame is more incommodious to paſſe, or to fill to the enemie: but the ſame is hurtfull to the retraite of the ſouldiers that ſally, and keepeth them vp as it were in mue, and ſeldome is any ground ſo leuell, but that in ſome place or other, the water may be let out of the ditches: contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe dry ditches make fortreſſes more ſubiect to ſurpriſes, but yet they are more commodious for ſouldiers to ſally out, and to fauour the retraite of thoſe that come backe. If there be heapes of ſtones in them, the canon doeth more hurt to the enemy beating among them. Finally, the dry ditch giueth the ſouldiers meanes to defend their contreſcarpe, which thoſe that are enuironed with water, doe as it were yeeld vp to the enemy. There fore where the fortreſſe is ſtrong, and well flanked, and manned, it is better to haue a dry ditch: where it is weake, and euill furniſhed with ſouldiers, it is better to haue dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches deepe, and full of water.</p>
               <p>The laſt defence which is thought of, but firſt loſt, or wonne, is the coutreſcarpe, or banke without the ditch. The ſame is to be faſhioned according to the ditch. In the making of it, we are to reſpect three pointes, according to the three parts of it. Firſt, that the ſame be made ſo plaine on the toppe, that the enemy doe not hide himſelfe behinde it, and vſe it for a parapet. Secondly, that toward the ditch there be made a couert or cloſe way, foure foote broad, and foure foote and a halfe high. Wherein the ſouldiers lying, may hinder the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of thoſe, that come to viewe the walles, or full the ditch, or place their artillery; and ſallying, may retire thither ſafely, being pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the enemy. Thirdly, that the pendant or banke of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſcarpe be made ſo ſlope, that the ſouldiers may goe downe in all places without breaking their armes or their legges, although they cannot come vp vpon it, but at the ſtaires.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the common defences of Townes or Caſtles, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, by the ſame rules others may be deuiſed. Of late there is an <hi>Italian,</hi> that hath deuiſed by certeine terraſſes of earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the walles, to keepe the enemy from battering the cortine of
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:18564:147"/>the wall: and therefore he calleth them <hi>contraguardie.</hi> the ſame are thus to be faſhioned.</p>
               <p>The cortine of the wall is to bee made bending inwarde ſome eight or tenne paſes from the right line in the middeſt. eight paſes from this is a rampar of earth to bee raiſed all along the cortine betweene bulwarke, and bulwarke, higher then the contreſcarpe, but lower then the parapet of the wall. this rampar is to haue a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert way like to the contreſcarpe inward, &amp; being made low towards the ditch is there likewiſe to haue a parapet. the ſame at the endes is to be made ſmall, ſo that it doe not hinder the artillery of the bulwarke to ſcoure the ditch. the artillery of the towne that is placed at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward angle of the cortine is to beate all along the ditch, and flanke of this contregard.</p>
               <p>This manner of fortification hauing ſo many parapets and flankers, and ſuch a thickeneſſe of earth, hee ſuppoſeth that no batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhall be able to force: but on the otherſide hee conſidereth not, that the forces of the caſtle or towne being not great are not ſufficient to furniſh ſo many places, nor conuenient that they ſhoulde into ſo many partes bee deuided: neither doth hee thinke, that it is more eaſie to fortifie two townes or caſtles, then to builde theſe double de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſes: nor that the charge would be infinite.</p>
               <p>It is reported, that the Caſtle of And warp coſt <hi>a hundreth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand duckats building.</hi> what then woulde a citadel coſt, that hath double the defenſes, and workes, and requireth twiſe ſo many men, and twiſe ſo much ordonance? if fewe goe to the coſt of fortification with ſtone, and content themſelues with bankes of earth, it is not likely that any beſide the worke of ſtone will make ſo many ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes of earth, as by the rules of this kinde of Italian fortification is required.</p>
               <p>The Prince of Orenge in his time traced diuers bankes about ſuch places as hee thought neceſſarie to bee defended; as about <hi>William ſtat,</hi> and others, where there is ſcarce any bulwarke, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualier, or good platforme. but the walles being made in and out, the inward angle of one part is made with great ordonance and moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets to flanke the other. beſides this, the Rampar is ſo large, that the artillerie placed thereon, may bee made to ſerue to many purpoſes.</p>

               <p>He that vnderſtandeth theſe rules, and withall the vſe of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and all leſſer pieces together with their effects: in what ground ſoeuer he is, may vnderſtand how to defend himſelfe and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſo long as his victuals and munitions laſt. For example, if he be taken in plaine ground, and would there lie ſafelie; let him trace his bankes and trenches either fiue ſquare, or ſixe ſquare with bulwarkes or terraſſes at euerie corner like vnto a caſtle or towne fortified: hee may make it big, or leſſe according to his number. If he be appointed to gard the paſſage of a riuer, hee may vnderſtand how to couer his companie, that hee bee neither forced in front, nor on the banke. Such places as are aduantageous by nature as hils and ſtraites, he knoweth how to make ſtronger by labour. The<note n="a" place="margin">Guicciard.</note>

               <p>Theſe rules may alſo teach vs how to ſtrengthen ſuch townes as are alreadie walled and ditched, though weakelie, and for the vſe of the canon vnprofitablie. The defences of walles made inartificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, are diuers. Firſt, rampiers caſt vp behinde the walles. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, retrenchments with bankes made toward the towne with a ſtrong parapet, ſuch as before I haue deſcribed. Thirdly, plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes made at the corners or on the cortine of the walles, made in ſuch places, as our artillerie may beſt ſerue to flanke our walles and ditches.</p>
               <p>The like effect haue mountes, rayſed behinde the wall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the rampar. Fourthlie, rauelins placed from the wall forward, where the ſame is moſt ſtraight, and the ground moſt euen. The ſame are to be made fiue ſquare, or at leaſt three ſquare, and raiſed of earth and roddes mingled and rammed cloſe together, about the which a broad and deepe ditch is to bee wrought. The laſt defence is in the depth of the ditches, and ſtrength of the counterſcarpe, which is to be wrought artificiallie all along where wee thinke the enemie will aſſayle vs.</p>
               <p>When the gouernour of the towne hath vſed all poſſible means for
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:18564:148"/>defence of himſelfe and his companie, and yet through either long ſiege, or want of ſupplie, or ſuccour can hold the place no longer, let him before hee attempt extremities, declare his eſtate to thoſe that gaue him the place to gard. After that, if he neither receiue ſuccour, nor anſwere, let him call the colonels, captains and chiefe citizens to counſell, and reſolue in time what to doe. The firſt point to be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, is, whether by any poſſibilitie the place may bee defended any longer, conſideration had of the number of ſeruiceable men, of the want of victuals and munitions, and weakeneſſe of the place that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth almoſt open to the enemie; likewiſe of the reſolution of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and deſpaire of ſuccour. And if it appeare that the ſame cannot longer be defended, the next point to bee conſidered is, whether the ſame be to be yeelded vpon honourable compoſition, or to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and forſaken. In this caſe the qualities of the enemie are to bee reſpected. For better it is, to runne into any hazard, yea and to die fighting, then to yeeld to him that perfourmeth no promiſe, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth and maſſacreth men after yeelding. If it bee reſolued, that it is beſt to attempt to eſcape by breaking through the campe, the next point to bee conſidered is, by what meanes, and at what time and place the ſame is to bee perfourmed. <hi>The</hi>

               <p>Neceſſarie compoſition therefore, ſo it be in extremitie, is not to be refuſed. But yet while we talke of compoſition, we are to vſe great circumſpection and care; firſt that the garriſon be not diſcouraged; ſecondly that the ſame growe not more ſecure, and careleſſe; thirdly that vnder colour of <hi>parley</hi> the enemy doe not view the walles, or ditches or breach, or attempt to ſeaſe the breach or the gate, or els en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terteine ſome intelligence with ſome within: which things how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous they are, I haue heretofore declared. To auoyd theſe dangers this courſe is beſt; the neceſſitie of the towne, and other ſecrets are to be kept from the knowledge of the ſouldiers, who by good wordes are to be encouraged, and made acquainted with ſo much onely, as is neceſſary: ſecondly ſuch men onely are to be deputed to <hi>parley,</hi> as are well knowne for their ſufficiencie, and loyaltie: thirdly the place of <hi>parley</hi> is to be appointed farre from the towne, that the ſouldiers within heare nothing.

               </p>
               <p>In <hi>capitulations</hi> two things are eſpecially to be reſpected, firſt that the conditions be honourable, and fauourable: ſecondly that the ſame be performed. The moſt reaſonable compoſition that may be, is when they within keepe the place ſtill, paying onely certaine money, or looſing onely ſome other commoditie. So <hi>Rome</hi> was redeemed from <hi>Porſena</hi> that beſieged it; and ſo they that were beſieged by the <hi>Gaules</hi> in the <hi>Capitol</hi> redeemed themſelues. And <hi>Rochel</hi> eſcaped the more eaſily y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hands of them that beeſiegd the towne, by compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for money. Contrarywiſe of all pointes it is moſt extreeme, to yeeld vp the place to the enemie. If the <hi>Saguntins</hi> would haue yeelded vp their towne to <hi>Annibal,</hi> and conſented to haue dwelt ſome other where: they might haue ſaued themſelues, and their goods; but they would not. There is yet a meane betwixt theſe two, when thoſe that yeeld to the enemy do promiſe him to become his ſubiects, and to pay him certaine tribute, and ſo keepe the place vnder his dominion.</p>
               <p>If then by any ſumme of money we may redeeme our ſelues, and our citie driuen to ſuch extremitie, let vs not priſe golde aboue ſafetie: on the other ſide if we be not in extremitie, let vs not ſell our aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages for money. When I reade former hiſtories, I cannot but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the baſeneſſe of many of our nation, that in times paſt haue bene bought out of their places for money: and lament, that ſome accomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, wel otherwiſe, ſhould therein deale more diſhonourably, &amp; foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly then other nations. For what could be more diſhonorable, then the ſurrender of <hi>Terwin, Torney, Bollein,</hi> &amp; other places, or the loſſe of <hi>Caleis?</hi> and what more ridiculous, then that our army going to fight, ſhould with a few <hi>French</hi> crownes be bought out, and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to returne?</p>
               <p>But if the enemy will heare of no compoſition without ſurrender of the place, the next conſideration is, that we may be aſſured of our liues, and depart with our horſes, and armes without diſgrace. By the <hi>capitulation of S.</hi>

                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:18564:149"/>Like honourable compoſition had our men in the late ſurrender of <hi>Scluce.</hi> The more reſolute the garriſon ſheweth it ſelfe in ſtanding vpon points, the more honourable their compoſition doth commonly prooue. And contrarywiſe thoſe that will needes compound, looſe both life and honor. The <hi>Romanes</hi> for the moſt part would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound without ſurrender made of the defendants armes: but the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient faith and loyalty of the <hi>Romanes</hi> being now loſt and gone, let it be iudged, what wiſedome it is for men to put themſelues into diſſoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all mens handes all naked.</p>
               <p>The greateſt difficulty is in procuring of good aſſurance of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of ſurrender made. which is moſt of all to be ſtood vpon. For what auaileth it to haue good words without performance? In theſe late brabbles of <hi>France</hi> the garriſons of <hi>Mucidam,</hi> and <hi>Mailè,</hi> and diuers other places haue bene cut in pieces contrary to compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.

In which rolle, ſeeing the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> doe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter all that are not of the Papall faction, it behooueth vs to looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, how wee doe truſt them. eſpecially giuing vs ſuch warning by the feined treaty of <hi>Dunkirke.</hi> Beſide all this, a certeine <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a great man of law in the Lowe countries, affirmeth, <hi>that all</hi>

A matter apparant by diuers examples. The <hi>Athenians,</hi> although their countrey was all waſted, and the people driuen by the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> their enemies, to hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> walles of the Citie; <hi>yet ſo long as they were</hi>

By which meanes, in the ende they vanquiſhed their enemies, and recouered their loſſes with great aduantage both of wealth, and honour. <hi>The Cities likewiſe on the coaſt of</hi>

                  <hi>France, which is nowe called Briteine, although they could not defend themſelues againſt Caeſars forces at land, yet ſuffered no great loſſe, as long as they had ſhips to commaund at Sea.</hi> Their ſhips furniſhed them with things neceſſarie being beſieged, the ſame conueyed the men &amp; their goods away being diſtreſſed. Contrariwiſe howe ſtrong ſoeuer a Nation is by land, yet cannot the ſame mainteine it ſelfe long, nor continue in reputation without a ſufficient power at Sea. The <hi>Romanes</hi> were driuen to great ſtraytes by the Pirates, that kept the rule of the Sea a great time, and continued it vntill ſuch time, as they were driuen thence by the victory of <hi>Pompey</hi> the great. <hi>Sext. Pompeius</hi> keeping the Seas with his ſhips, draue <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Antony</hi> to a harde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> could not remedy the ſpoiles of their countrey made by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> incurſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the <hi>Athenian</hi> ſhips, nor could <hi>Caeſar</hi> haue reaſon of the coaſt Townes of <hi>France,</hi> before he had prouided a Nauy, &amp; vanquiſhed them at Sea. Neither ſhall euer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

                  <hi>Low-countries</hi> ſo long as they can keep y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea: but if they faile of that, it would goe hard with them. This was the cauſe that made the <hi>Romanes,</hi> albeit before that vnacquainted with ſea cauſes to arme to ſea. Without their nauy they could neither haue defended their Empire againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Carthaginians</hi> firſt, nor afterward againſt the pyrates, nor without ſtrength at ſea coulde either <hi>Caeſar</hi> haue ſubdued the coaſt townes of <hi>France,</hi> or entred this Iland. Nor could <hi>Auguſtus</hi> haue vanquiſhed <hi>Pompey,</hi> nor the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> preuailed againſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                  <hi>Athenians.</hi> The experience of theſe nations, and great warriers, doth teach vs this concluſion, that if we meane either to mainteine the honor, &amp; reputation of our countrey, or to defend our ſelues againſt the enemie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purſueth vs, or to proſecute iniuries done vnto vs, or to aide our friends that craue our helpe, we muſt haue dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent regard to our ſeafaring men, &amp; ſhipping, that both may be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, &amp; kept in order. Our owne experience, &amp; diuers reaſons may teach vs the ſame. Before that this Nation did vſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea, firſt the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes,</hi> then the <hi>Saxons,</hi> after them the <hi>Danes,</hi> &amp; nowe laſt of all the <hi>Normans,</hi> haue taken &amp; poſſeſſed diuers partes of this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could we wanting ſufficient force at ſea, reſiſt them. Sithence that the kings of <hi>England</hi> haue had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernment at ſea, neither haue forreine nations had like courage to inuade vs, nor haue we wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted meanes to defend our ſelues, or aide our friends. If that our ſhips had not had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vantage of ſayling, when the <hi>Spaniard</hi> came to inuade vs, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we had wanted ſhipping, God knoweth what would haue bin the iſſue. How much then is it better nowe, then when our aunceſters had neither nauy to defend their coaſts, nor to tranſport their armies to purſue their right, or help their friends? in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> daies of king Edward the <hi>3.</hi> and Edward the <hi>4.</hi> our nation for want of ſhipping, was behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Flemmings</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> for ſhipping, to tranſport the <hi>Engliſh</hi> armie into <hi>France.</hi> The vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nauy is great in peace, greater in warres. Thereby trafique, &amp; entercourſe betwixt friends is mainteined: victuals y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> goe to the enemies are ſtopped, our wants of victuals, armes, munition, &amp; other neceſſaries are ſupplied: the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies coaſt is ſpoiled, our owne defended: the coaſt townes of the enemies countrey, that liue vpon the ſea are brought to great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, our owne mainteined. Without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame neither can the trade of marchandize be mainteined, nor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſea townes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemie be beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor their country ſpoyled, nor can we vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> enemies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings,

                  <hi>although in all pointes elſe hee were ſuperiour to the Maſſilians, yet by reaſon their ſhips were lighter and ſwifter, could he not ouerthrowe them, although many times hee foyled them.</hi>
                  <pb n="281" facs="tcp:18564:154"/>If they be too weake, thoſe that are ſwift of ſayle may ſafely depart, if they preuaile, no ſhippe can eſcape them by ſayling. They ought likewiſe to bee made ſtrong, both to abide the force of the Sea in a ſtorme, &amp; to beare the ſhaking of our owne ordonance, and the blows of the enemies. How that is to be wrought, I referre my ſelfe to the maſters of the occupation.</p>
               <p>Further, ſhips may not want victualles while they are at ſea, leaſt either hauing the aduantage, they be driuen to giue it ouer, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken at aduantage, they be not able to abide it out. And moſt abſurde it were if ſhips that go to fight ſhould want ordonance, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and armes to fight with. Firſt therfore there ought to be good ordonance mounted on their carriages, and fitted with their rings &amp; tacle, and al inſtruments neceſſary. Of al peeces the demy coluerine in the noſe and poope is moſt effectuall, both for the long reach, and for that it giueth the fire all out of the ſhip. There woulde be ſtore of croſſe barres, chaine ſhot, and other bullets. How many peeces there ought to be in euery ſhip, it cannot be determined, conſidering the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers makings and burthens of ſhips. Much leſſe can it be reſolued what munitions, victuals, and furniture for great ordonance muſt be prouided further then in general, that there muſt be ſufficient. Beſide the great ordonance there ought to be prouiſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made of moſquets, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuers, and piſtoles, ſwords &amp; daggers, halfe pikes, halberds, glaiues, blackbils, and other ſortes of weapons, &amp; for the defenſe of the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers good cuyraces and morions, and targets both of proofe &amp; ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Likewiſe there woulde bee rampars made of wooll, and for the defenſe of the waſte and the decke a ſtrong netting. Beſide caſtles made in the poope, and foredecke for garde of the ſhip. For which there would be made alſo mantellets of plankes filled with occum ſtuffed betweene, and moueable, that they may bee employed where neede is. The caſtles would alſo be made to take downe, that in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſhip be not hindred by them. There would alſo turrets, brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges or frames of wood be made leaning ouer boord, that our men might more eaſily boorde the enemie. The toppes would bee fenſed with ſome frame of boords lined with occum &amp; furniſhed with ſtone &amp; ſhot. But that need not be before we come to ioine. The yard arms would haue ſharp hooks in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to cut the tacle of the enemies ſhips.</p>
               <p>To fire the enemies ſhippes there would be balles of wildefire, and other fire workes and engins deuiſed, and to quench the enemies fire
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:18564:155"/>ſtore of clay, vineger, and water ſet ready. Beſides all this, axes, hammers, wimbles, &amp; al inſtruments to worke withal, and in ſumme whatſoeuer may ſerue to annoy the enemy or defend our ſelues, the ſame is to be prouided.</p>

                  <hi>Carthaginian ſhippes encountring with the Romanes were not able to make any fight for want of ſouldiers, albeit they had ſtore of mariners.</hi> And in the encounters that <hi>Caeſar</hi> had at ſea againſt diuers enemies, it was not the marriner, but the legionarie ſouldier that gaue him the victorie. Howſoeuer it is either with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, or ſouldiers, or both, our ſhips are to be furniſhed ſo, that both the great ordonance may be employed in the roomes below, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers be placed to do all ſeruices neceſſary in the houle of the ſhip, and alſo all the deckes and parts aboue be well manned and garded: not forgetting the tops and other places.</p>

               <p>Some, I doubt not, doe thinke to make them ducke at ſea with great ſhot. And therefore as they prouide ſomewhat ſlenderly for that, ſo for other matters they goe to ſea altogether vnprouided. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:18564:155"/>that I vnderſtand that in ſome places the Princes ſhipping haue for the moſt part ſpeciall inſtructions not to graple. Matters very ridiculous to thoſe that haue but any ſmall ſkill at ſea. For it is not alwayes in their power to take and leaue, as the lamentable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of ſome of late hath declared. Where the enemies ſhippes are ſwifter then thine, he may if he find thee at ſea, and liſt to fight, force thee againſt thy will to fight, or to yeeld. Yea admit he hath only ſome ſhips ſwifter then thine, yet will it ſuffice to force thee to a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall fight, vnleſſe thou meaneſt ſhamefully to abandon to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies curteſie ſuch ſhips, as are ſlower of ſaile, then the reſt. For we may not thinke that alwayes we ſhal meete with ſuch a General, as the duke of <hi>Medina Sidonia</hi> that alwayes fled, and neuer made head againe, or with thoſe that haue commiſſion to flie, and not to fight. Which if we do, then beware thoſe that are hindermoſt. Beſides this our ſhips may be taken ſometimes in harbour, or at ſome aduantage whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they cannot flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the enemie. Were it not expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in this caſe, that thy ſhips were wel prouided forgrapling, &amp; al maner of defence? vnleſſe they be ſo furniſhed, how can they abide a brunt, or ſtay a time vntil they be ſuccored? or how can they be ſuccored, vnles the ſuccors be prouided for grapling? Finally ſuppoſe all thy nauy were ſwifter then the beſt ſhips of the enemy (which cannot be) and that thou had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt alwayes ſea-roome, which cannot be hoped: yet all this maketh little to fighting, but rather to flying. The <hi>Parthians</hi> that ſhot backeward flying, yet did not alwayes flie, but now and then charge the enemy, if aduantage were offered. Sure in this kinde of fight of ſhippes there is altogether no honour, no nor profite. For how can they that flie ſubdue the enemy that commeth to ſpoile their coaſts? Howe can they hinder him, but that hee may goe whither hee liſteth, and returne when hee liſteth, the winde and weather ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him? Suppoſe that by ſhot thou ſhouldeſt ſincke a ſhippe, yet the men may ſtill be ſaued. Thoſe therefore that thus fight ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and neuer come neere, are like vnto thoſe that ſtrike the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie downe, but dare not ſet their feete vpon him, and diſpatche him.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe that thinke to worke wonders with great ſhot, they doe onely feede themſelues with imaginations, that the enemie is like to women or children, that feare the noiſe of great peeces. For other great hurte it doeth not, vnleſſe it be to Marchants ſhippes
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:18564:156"/>heauy laden, and where the men within cannot come to ſtop leakes. if the ſea moue neuer ſo little, twentie to one but the ſhot falleth ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hie, or lowe, vnles the ſhips come very neere, which in fight with a nauy of ſhips, I ſuppoſe, no one ſhip wil, and many cannot for feare of grapling, which they forſweare. I would gladly knowe of theſe men how many ſhips they haue knowen to haue bin taken with this maner of fight. <hi>Don Pedroes</hi> ſhip, although abandoned of all her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, yet would neuer haue yeelded, but that they within imagined they ſhould be boorded of all the fleete. Thoſe ſhips that fell among the flats before <hi>Vliſhingen</hi> being a remainder of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> fleete, yet abode a charge, and would not yeeld, but vpon feare they ſhould haue beene inueſted. Did not our men at <hi>Coronna</hi> beate a great Biſkaine ſhip from the land within moſquet ſhot a whole day with diuers great peeces? yet could they neyther ſinke the ſhip, nor force the men to yeeld before that with their boats they made countenance either to fire her, or to boord her. They of <hi>Rochel <hi>An.</hi> 1569.</hi> beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging <hi>Brouage</hi> brought the great <hi>Venetian</hi> carrake hard to the ſide of the caſtle: whence a man might haue ſpit into her, not only hit her, and ſhot into her. Yet could not they of the caſtle with all their canon ſhot eyther ſinke her, or greatly hurt her, but ſhee hurte them much more. By grapling I haue heard of many ouercome at ſea, both in ancient time, and alſo of late dayes, as in the gulfe of <hi>Lepanto</hi> where the chriſtians ouer came the <hi>Turkes;</hi> and <hi>in the encounter betwixt the</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Guicciard. hiſt.</note>
                  <hi>Spaniards and Philip Doria, where Hugh Moncada and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Spaniards died of the ſword, not of the bullet.</hi> But if great or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donance could do ſo much as is ſuppoſed, yet where ſhould we haue ſhot, and pouder to furniſh the continuall ſhot of our ſhippes: when in the encounter betwixt the <hi>Spaniard</hi> and vs at ſea, in one two daies moſt of the ſhippes had ſpent all their pouder, without any ſenſible loſſe to the enemy?</p>
               <p>How ſhall we driue the <hi>Spaniard</hi> out of our ports without grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, if he come once againe as he threatneth? How can we ſuccour any towne by him beſieged by ſea without fighting? <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſhippes were heauy of ſaile, yet lying before <hi>Maſſilia,</hi> they could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, nor could anie victualles enter into the towne by them. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the <hi>Spaniard</hi> beene ſo eaſily remooued from before <hi>Caleis,</hi> but that God ſtroke them with feare without euident cauſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that are afraide to venture their ſhippes of warre (a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:18564:156"/>colour for ſuch cowards) they may alſo be afraid to venture in the defence of their country. For without aduenturing not only of tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but alſo of mens liues, which (howſoeuer ſome now in our time do not value thouſands of men at the price of one rotten ſhip) are far more pretious, our country cannot be defended, nor the prince ſerued. Theſe men therefore, let them keepe their decayed wits, and ioyntes warme, and let them not henceforth tell vs of things impoſſible, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, yea and very dangerous. For the way to hazard our ſhips, is not by boording, but by ſparing of mony, when they are not, as they ſhould be furniſhed for fight, but muſt needes fall into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, if euer they be taken at any diſaduantage, by the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their maſtes, tearing, or burning of their ſailes, or cutting of their tacle. This is a feare that neither the <hi>Romanes,</hi> nor <hi>Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> nor other nation euer feared; and yet fire was then as da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gerous as now. Neither the <hi>Spaniards, French,</hi> nor <hi>Dutch</hi> feare any ſuch matter, neither do our men of warre that go to ſea forecaſt it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then ſhould our beſt ſhippes, and ſuch as ſhould be beſt furniſhed feare, more then others, this courſe eſpecially being ſo fit to make the nauy of <hi>England</hi> vnprofitable, &amp; to giue the enemy the victory? if this be not ſo, let it be ſhewed where the Queens ſhips haue taken any ſhip of warre by canonades: but of marchants ſhips, &amp; other men of warre we haue heard of diuers, that by boording haue preuailed.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore ſo prouide, that wee neede not to feare any ſuch danger, and that we may not onely ouercome the enemy with flying, but with fighting, as our anceſtors did in the dayes of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, and <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8.</hi> famous kings of this land, and as our ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and mariners would now do, if mens hands were not bound, and their hearts broken, whereas men ſhould endeuour to encourage them, and whet them, to go forward.</p>
               <p>In fighting at ſeathe Admiral, that hath his ſhips wel trimmed, and al things ready muſt haue care alſo further, that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany may haue the aduantage of the winde, and keepe good order in the ſayling of the ſhips, that one go not before an other, that he range his nauie with ſupplies, and finally that he prouide, whatſoeuer elſe is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary or requiſite for the obtaining of victorie.</p>
               <p>Thoſe that haue the wind on their backes, haue thereby many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantages: their ſhot doth more hurte the ſide of the enemies ſhip ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp, then the enemies ſhot can hurt their ſhips: their fire is eaſily
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:18564:157"/>carried into the enemies veſſelles; the ſmoke of the ordonance doth blinde the enemies. Among other things, the vantage of the winde did greatly further the victory of the Chriſtians againſt the <hi>Turkes</hi> in the gulfe of <hi>Lepanto.</hi> The array and good order of the nauie doth bring with it this helpe; that one ſhip is not lightly enuironed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, and further, that one ſhip is ready to ſuccour another. And therefore as in fight at land, ſo at ſea likewiſe an order, and array is to be kept of ſhips ſailing to fight. The moſt common array is that the front of the battell be diuided into three parts, into the right cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner or wing, into the mid battell, and into the left corner. Euery one of theſe are to haue other ſhips appointed not onely to ſuccour thoſe that fight, but alſo to fight with thoſe that offer themſelues to charge the nauie behinde.</p>
               <p>The maner of ſea fight is the ſame with the whole nauy, that ſhips meeting ſingle do vſe. Firſt they aſſaile the enemy with their great ſhot: which would be done only whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhips come very neere: then they charge him with the ſmal ſhot. Thoſe that ſuppoſe themſelues to be the ſtronger do lay hold vpon their enemies ſhip, &amp; force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to enter the ſame. In the mean while neither do they, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are in the tops of the ſhips, nor others that haue the charge of fire workes ceaſe to do their endeuor. And that with great care leſt they hurt themſelues, or their fellows. <hi>The</hi>

Seeing peace is ſo eaſily violated vpon light occaſions; hee is not wiſe, that will truſt the enemy too farre.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly great care is to be taken that wee yeelde no aduantage to the enemy. The firſt iniury that we receiue at the enemies handes is but a ſtep to the next, as hath bene ſhewed, and he that from the top of the ſtaires deſcendeth one ſtep, ſhall ſooner be thruſt downe to the bottome, then recouer the top againe. Hee that once beginneth to fall, is eaſily ouerthrowen.

               <p>The time to treat of peace which is fourthly to be conſidered, is when both parties haue taſted of the cup of calamities that warres bring with them, and yet neither part is ouerthrowen, or throughly vanquiſhed. <hi>When things doe hang in equall ballance, then is the fitteſt time to treat of peace by the iudgement of Annibal, and then</hi>

                  <hi>moſt equall conditions are liked of both parties.</hi> For being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the conquerour giueth rather then receiueth conditions: as the <hi>Romanes</hi> did to the <hi>Carthaginians,</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedonia,</hi> to <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and to other Princes, and nations which they van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed.</p>
               <p>Further wee are to looke that the conditions of peace be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. If we contend about limits, townes, or countreys, it is no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to looſe our right: if we haue wrong done vnto vs, it is no reaſon we ſhould reſt without ſatiſfaction. But becauſe conditions are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers according to the cauſes of warre, the times, and perſons that contend, and diuers other circumſtances: therefore that is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:18564:159"/>to the iudgement of thoſe, that are employed in ſuch affayres. Whoſe chiefe ends ſhould be the maieſty of God, the honor of the Prince, the ſafety, and profit of their countrey.</p>
               <p>But moſt eſpeciall care is to be had, that the conditions be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. without which all the treaty is nothing, but a vayne ſhewe of fayre wordes. This I commend as a ſpecall matter to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of our nation, who although many times they were victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the fielde againſt the <hi>French,</hi> yet ſeldome could match them in concluſions of peace: and alſo becauſe it is a hard matter to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conditions of peace.

               <p>Ambaſſadours therefore woulde be well choſen, and diſcreetely ought they to handle their buſineſſe, without curious intermedling with affayres that concerne them not. <hi>Tully</hi> ieſteth at a certaine Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſade conſiſting of three perſons, one of which was an idiot, the ſecond had a great ſcarre in his head, the third had the gout.
